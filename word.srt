2
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,980
Get up! Get up!

3
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,460
The winner,

4
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,720
by total annihilation,

5
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,680
Yama!

6
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,020
Who is next?

7
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Who has the guts to step into the ring with little Yama?

8
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,180
Yama!

9
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,730
Can I try?

10
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,150
I have a robot. I built it myself.

11
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,120
Beat it, kid.

12
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,040
House rules. You gotta pay to play.

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,500
Is this enough?

14
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,540
What's your name, little boy?

15
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,340
Hiro. Hiro Hamada.

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,090
Prepare your bot, zero.

17
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,560
Two bots enter,

18
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,860
one bot leaves.

19
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,990
Fighters ready?

20
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,270
Fight!

21
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,340
That was my first fight. I... Can I try again?

22
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,370
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

23
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,250
Go home.

24
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,870
I've got more money.

25
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,340
Fighters ready?

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,980
Fight!

27
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,260
Mega-bot, destroy.

28
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,820
What?

29
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,630
- No more little Yama. - But, wha...

30
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,420
This is not possible!

31
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,230
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

32
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,800
Beginner's luck.

33
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,310
Do you want to go again, Yama?

34
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,280
No one hustles Yama!

35
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,860
Teach him a lesson.

36
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,980
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.

37
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,950
- Hiro! Get on! - Tadashi!

38
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,620
Good timing!

39
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,830
Oh, mama!

40
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,540
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,890
- Are you hurt? - No.

42
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,010
Then what were you thinking, knucklehead?

43
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,770
You graduated high school when you were 13,

44
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,890
and this is what you're doing?

45
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
There they are!

46
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,530
Hold on!

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,770
Yes!

48
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,310
Get back here.

49
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,440
Bot fighting is illegal.

50
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,240
You're going to get yourself arrested.

51
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Bot fighting is not illegal.

52
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,910
Betting on bot fighting, that's... that's illegal.

53
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,170
But so lucrative!

54
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,630
I'm on a roll, big brother! And there is no stopping me!

55
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Oh, no.

57
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,980
Hi, Aunt Cass.

58
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,050
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.

59
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,610
- We're fine. - We're okay.

60
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,930
Oh, good.

61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,030
Then what were you two knuckleheads thinking?

62
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
For 10 years,

63
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,660
I have done the best I could to raise you.

64
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,520
Have I been perfect? No.

65
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,580
Do I know anything about children? No.

66
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,490
Should I have picked up a book on parenting?

67
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,830
Probably!

68
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,120
Where was I going with this? I had a point.

69
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,380
- Sorry. - We love you, Aunt Cass.

70
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,910
Well, I love you, too!

71
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,010
I had to close up early because of you two felons.

72
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,290
On beat poetry night.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,090
Stress eating. Because of you.

74
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,340
Come on, Mochi.

75
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,470
This is really good!

76
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,820
You better make this up to Aunt Cass

77
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,340
before she eats everything in the cafe.

78
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,640
For sure.

79
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,940
And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.

80
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,970
Absolutely.

81
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,860
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

82
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,320
There's a fight across town. If I book, I can still make it.

83
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,730
When are you gonna

84
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,780
start doing something with that big brain of yours?

85
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,700
What? Go to college like you?

86
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,580
So people can tell me stuff I already know?

87
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,420
Unbelievable.

88
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,030
What would mom and dad say?

89
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,300
I don't know.

90
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,010
They're gone.

91
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,380
They died when I was three, remember?

92
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,130
- I'll take you. - Really?

93
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,420
I can't stop you from going,

94
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,880
but I'm not going to let you go on your own.

95
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,190
Sweet.

97
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,860
What are we doing at your nerd school?

98
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,560
Bot-fight's that way!

100
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,110
Gotta grab something.

101
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,810
Is this gonna take long?

102
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,280
Relax, you big baby. We'll be in and out.

103
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,910
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,750
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

105
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,990
Heads up!

106
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,640
Electro-mag suspension?

107
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,270
- Who are you? - I'm...

108
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,350
Go go, this is my brother Hiro.

109
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,990
Welcome to the nerd lab.

110
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Yeah.

111
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,660
I've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.

112
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,330
Zero resistance, faster bike.

113
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,160
But, not fast enough,

114
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,710
yet.

115
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,170
Do not move. Behind the line, please.

116
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,970
Hey, Wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.

117
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,560
Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.

118
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,630
Catch.

119
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,610
- Laser-induced plasma? - Oh, yeah.

120
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,610
With a little magnetic confinement for ultra-precision.

121
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,820
Wow. How do you find anything in this mess?

122
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,820
I have a system.

123
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,950
There's a place for everything,

124
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,900
and everything in its place.

125
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,410
- Need this! - You can't do that!

126
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,610
This is anarchy! Society has rules!

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,460
Excuse me!

128
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,070
Coming through!

129
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,740
Tadashi!

130
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,870
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

131
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I've heard so much about you!

132
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,290
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

133
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,890
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

134
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,630
400 pounds of it!

135
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,960
Come here, come here, come here.

136
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,760
You're going to love this.

137
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,050
A dash of perchloric acid, a smidge of cobalt,

138
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,730
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

139
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,350
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...

140
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,810
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

141
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,360
It's so pink.

142
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,280
Here's the best part.

143
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,040
I know, right?

144
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,410
Chemical metal embrittlement.

145
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,050
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

146
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,830
"Honey Lemon"? "Go go"? "Wasabi"?

147
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,050
I spill wasabi on my shirt one time, people.

148
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,510
One time!

149
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,810
Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.

150
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,350
Who's Fred?

151
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,930
This guy, right here!

152
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,650
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,190
This is not my real face and body.

154
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,470
The name's Fred.

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,520
School mascot by day, but by night,

156
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,650
I am also a school mascot.

157
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,200
So, what's your major?

158
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,740
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

159
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,910
But I am a major science enthusiast.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,120
I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula,

161
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,250
that can turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will.

162
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,660
But she says that's "Not science."

163
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,910
It's really not.

164
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,630
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

165
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,590
I asked Wasabi for isn't "Science" either.

166
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,790
- Is it? - Nope.

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,630
Well, then, what about "Invisible sandwich"?

168
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,840
- Hiro. - Imagine eating a sandwich,

169
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,920
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

170
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,050
Just stop.

171
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,340
- Laser eyes? - What?

172
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,220
- Tingly fingers? - Never gonna happen.

173
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,470
Hey, what about a growth serum?

174
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,610
So, what have you been working on?

175
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,930
I'll show you.

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,060
Duct tape?

177
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,020
I hate to break it to you, bro.

178
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,310
Already been invented.

179
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,870
Dude!

180
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Ow!

181
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,170
This is what I've been working on.

182
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
Hello. I am Baymax.

183
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,240
Your personal healthcare companion.

184
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,700
I was alerted to the need

185
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,160
for medical attention when you said, "Ow."

186
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,440
A robotic nurse.

187
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,490
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

188
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,490
Physical or emotional?

189
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,790
I will scan you now.

190
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,160
Scan complete.

191
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,880
You have a slight epidermal abrasion on your forearm.

192
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,590
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

193
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,260
What's in the spray, specifically?

194
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,350
The primary ingredient is Bacitracin.

195
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,020
That's a bummer. I'm actually allergic to that.

196
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,110
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

197
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,650
You do have a mild allergy to peanuts.

198
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,350
Not bad.

199
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,030
You've done some serious coding on this thing, huh?

200
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,150
Programed him with over 10,000 medical procedures.

202
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,830
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.

203
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,670
Vinyl?

204
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,960
Yeah, going for a non-threatening, huggable kind of thing.

205
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,170
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

206
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,800
- No offense. - I am a robot.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,210
I cannot be offended.

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,390
- Hyperspectral cameras? -Yep.

209
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,100
- Titanium skeleton? - Carbon fiber.

210
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,440
Right. Even lighter.

211
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,890
Killer actuators. Where did you get those?

212
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,640
Machined them right here, in-house.

213
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,030
- Really? - Yup.

214
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,690
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

215
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Shut up.

216
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,520
You have been a good boy. Have a lollipop.

217
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,870
Nice.

218
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,090
I cannot deactivate until you say

219
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,450
you are satisfied with your care.

220
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,450
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

221
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,580
He's going to help a lot of people.

222
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,700
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

223
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Lithium ion.

224
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,720
You know, supercapacitors would charge way faster.

225
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,960
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?

226
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,050
Hey, Professor.

227
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,090
Actually, I was just finishing up.

228
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,390
You must be Hiro.

229
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,050
Bot-fighter, right?

230
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,900
When my daughter was younger, that's all she wanted to do.

231
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,140
May I?

232
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,600
Sure.

233
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,070
Magnetic-bearing servos.

234
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,450
Pretty sick, huh?

235
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,770
Wanna see how I put 'em together?

236
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,330
Hey, genius!

237
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,280
He invented them.

238
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,740
You're Robert Callaghan?

239
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,570
Like, as in,

240
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,450
the Callaghan-catmull spline,

241
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,080
and Callaghan's "Laws of robotics"?

242
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,290
That's right.

243
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,120
Ever think about applying here?

244
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,670
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

245
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I don't know.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,250
He's pretty serious about his career in bot-fighting.

247
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,750
Well, kind of serious.

248
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,970
I can see why.

249
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,090
With your bot, winning must come easy.

250
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,010
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,200
Well, if you like things easy,

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,520
then my program isn't for you.

253
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,020
We push the boundaries of robotics here.

254
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,650
My students go on to shape the future.

255
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,450
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

256
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,030
Good luck with the bot-fights.

257
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,950
We gotta hurry if you want to catch that bot-fight.

258
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,750
I have to go here.

259
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,460
If I don't go to this nerd school,

260
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,830
I'm gonna lose my mind.

261
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
How do I get in?

263
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,220
Every year, the school has a student showcase.

264
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,200
You come up with something that blows Callaghan away,

265
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,930
you're in.

266
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,720
But, it's gotta be great.

268
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,140
Trust me.

269
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,300
It will be.

270
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,730
Nothing!

271
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,990
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!

272
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,330
Wow. Washed up at 14.

273
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,450
So sad.

274
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,330
I got nothing! I'm done. I'm never getting in.

275
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,340
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.

276
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,380
What are you doing?

277
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,840
Shake things up.

278
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,340
Use that big brain of yours to think your way out.

279
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,510
- What? - Look for a new angle.

280
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,210
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.

281
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,550
How are you feeling?

282
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,380
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.

283
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,230
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

284
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,440
Yep, he's nervous.

285
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,890
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

286
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,730
- He's so tense. - No, I'm not.

287
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,400
Relax, Hiro.

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,310
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go go.

289
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,040
Stop whining. Woman up.

290
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm fine!

291
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,560
What do you need, little man? Deodorant? Breath mint?

292
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Fresh pair of underpants?

293
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,790
Underpants? You need serious help.

294
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey, I come prepared.

295
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,110
I haven't done laundry in six months.

296
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,420
One pair lasts me four days.

297
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,570
I go front, I go back,

298
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,740
I go inside-out. Then I go front and back.

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,170
Wow. That is both disgusting and awesome.

300
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,510
Don't encourage him.

301
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,080
It's called "Recycling."

302
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,850
Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.

303
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,800
Oh, yeah. This is it.

304
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,970
I guess I'm up.

305
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,260
Okay, photo, photo! Everybody say, "Hiro."

306
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,840
- Hiro! - Yeah!

307
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,600
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

308
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,190
- Don't mess it up. - Break a leg, little man.

309
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,820
Science, yeah!

310
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,100
All right, bro. This is it.

311
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,700
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

312
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,780
What's going on?

313
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,330
I really want to go here.

314
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
You got this.

315
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,290
My name is Hiro...

316
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,930
Sorry.

317
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,770
My name is Hiro Hamada,

318
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,310
and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool.

319
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,310
I hope you like it.

320
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,150
This is a microbot.

321
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,460
Breathe.

322
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,660
It doesn't look like much,

323
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,040
but when it links up with the rest of its pals,

324
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,510
things get a little more interesting.

325
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,910
The microbots are controlled with this neural transmitter.

326
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,530
I think what I want them to do...

327
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,580
They do it.

328
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,870
The applications for this tech are limitless.

329
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,510
Construction.

330
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,340
What used to take teams of people working by hand

331
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,760
for months or years,

332
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,560
can now be accomplished by one person.

333
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,050
And that's just the beginning.

334
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,760
How about transportation?

335
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,390
Microbots can move anything anywhere,

336
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,200
with ease.

337
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,580
If you can think it, the microbots can do it.

338
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
The only limit is your imagination.

339
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,930
Microbots!

340
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,390
That's my nephew!

341
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,690
Yes!

342
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,480
My family! I love my family!

343
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,270
Nailed it!

344
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,270
- You did it! - Not bad!

345
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,280
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!

346
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,770
They loved you. That was amazing!

347
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,280
Yes.

348
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,580
With some development, your tech could be revolutionary.

349
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,820
Alistair Krei!

350
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,460
May I?

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,130
Extraordinary.

352
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,470
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

353
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,170
Shut up.

354
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,830
Mr. Krei is right.

355
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,840
Your microbots are an inspired piece of tech.

356
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,630
You can continue to develop them,

357
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,310
or you can sell them to a man

358
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,520
who's only guided by his own self-interest.

359
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,440
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

360
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,680
but it shouldn't affect...

361
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,470
This is your decision, Hiro.

362
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,690
But you should know

363
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,650
Mr. Krei has cut corners and ignored sound science

364
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
to get where he is.

365
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,150
That's just not true.

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,060
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech

367
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,870
with your microbots,

368
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,500
or anything else.

369
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,420
Hiro, I'm offering you

370
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,030
more money than any 14-year-old could imagine.

371
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,060
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,

372
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,460
but they're not for sale.

373
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,390
I thought you were smarter than that.

374
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,960
Robert.

375
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,060
Mr. Krei.

376
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,390
That's my brother's.

377
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,860
That's right.

378
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,200
I look forward to seeing you in class.

379
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,870
Unbelievable!

380
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,150
That's what I'm talking about.

381
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,960
All right, geniuses,

382
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,370
let's feed those hungry brains.

383
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Back to the cafe!

384
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,880
Dinner is on me!

385
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,880
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

386
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,870
- Aunt Cass? - Unless it's moldy.

387
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,370
We'll... we'll catch up, okay?

388
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,720
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

389
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,590
Both of you.

390
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,930
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

391
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,270
I know what you're going to say.

392
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,190
"I should be proud of myself,"

393
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,110
"because I'm finally using my gift for something important."

394
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,270
No, no. I was just gonna

395
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,030
tell you your fly was down for the whole show.

396
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,110
Ha-ha-hilarious.

397
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,080
What?

398
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,130
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

399
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,450
Hey, I...

400
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,430
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. So,

401
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,430
you know,

402
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,430
thanks for not giving up on me.

403
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,100
Are you okay?

404
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,780
Yeah. I'm okay.

405
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,570
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.

406
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,440
Tadashi, no!

407
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,420
Callaghan's in there.

408
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,790
Someone has to help.

409
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,810
Tadashi!

410
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,480
Tadashi!

411
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,040
Here. Have some tea.

412
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,240
Hey, sweetie.

413
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,690
Hey, Aunt Cass.

414
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,620
Mrs. Matsuda's in the cafe.

415
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,080
She's wearing something super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.

416
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,410
That always cracks you up.

417
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,580
You should come down.

418
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,960
Maybe later.

419
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,050
The university called again.

420
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,290
It's been a few weeks since classes started.

421
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,710
But they said it's not too late to register.

422
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,470
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.

424
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,950
Hey, Hiro.

425
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,820
We just wanted to check in, and see how you're doing.

426
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,090
We wish you were here, buddy.

427
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,120
Hiro, if I could have only one superpower right now,

428
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,670
it would be the ability to crawl through this camera,

429
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,130
and give you a big hug.

430
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Ow!

431
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,060
Hello. I am Baymax,

432
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,020
your personal healthcare companion.

433
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,020
Hey, Baymax.

434
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,860
I didn't know you were still active.

435
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,030
I heard a sound of distress.

436
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,650
What seems to be the trouble?

437
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,750
I just stubbed my toe a little.

438
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm fine.

439
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,200
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

440
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,210
A zero. I'm okay, really.

441
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,290
Thanks. You can shrink now.

442
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,970
Does it hurt when I touch it?

443
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,930
That's okay. No touching.

444
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,590
I'm fine...

445
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,050
You have fallen.

446
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,230
You think?

447
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,740
- On a scale of 1 to... - Ow!

448
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,100
On a scale...

449
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,270
On a sca...

450
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,620
On a scale of 1 to 10...

451
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,280
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

452
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,080
Zero.

453
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,450
- It is all right to cry. - No. No, no, no, no.

454
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,240
Crying is a natural response to pain.

455
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,410
I'm not crying.

456
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,910
- I will scan you for injuries. - Don't scan me.

457
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,750
- Scan complete. - Unbelievable.

458
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,760
You have sustained no injuries.

459
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,420
However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels

460
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,420
indicate that you are experiencing mood swings,

461
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,800
common in adolescence.

462
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,420
Diagnosis, puberty.

463
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,770
What?

464
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,350
Okay. Time to shrink now.

465
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,470
You should expect an increase in body hair,

466
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,110
especially on your face, chest, armpits, and...

467
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,490
Thank you! That's enough.

468
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,270
You may also experience strange and powerful new urges.

469
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,280
Okay! Let's get you back in your luggage.

470
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,510
I cannot deactivate until you say

471
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,450
you are satisfied with your care.

472
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,120
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

473
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,470
My microbot?

474
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,960
This doesn't make any sense.

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,430
Puberty can often be a confusing time

476
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,650
for a young adolescent flowering into manhood.

477
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,640
No. The thing is attracted to the other microbots,

478
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,640
but that's impossible.

479
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,810
They were destroyed in the fire.

480
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,990
Dumb thing's broken.

481
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,160
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

482
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,340
Oh, yeah?

483
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,010
Why don't you find out where it's trying to go?

484
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,660
Would that stabilize your pubescent mood swings?

485
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,220
Absolutely.

486
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,180
Baymax?

487
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,350
Baymax?

488
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,650
Baymax?

489
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,410
What?

490
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,540
- Hiro? - Hey, Aunt Cass!

491
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,910
Wow. You're up and...

492
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,870
Yeah! I figured it was time.

493
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,910
Are you registering for school?

494
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Yes.

495
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,950
I thought about what you said. Really inspired me.

496
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,380
Oh, honey, that's so great.

497
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,880
Okay,

498
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,300
special dinner tonight.

499
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,800
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

500
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,390
You know, with the hot sauce that makes our faces numb.

501
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,220
- Okay, sounds good. - Great!

502
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,890
Last hug.

503
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,070
Baymax!

504
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,240
Baymax!

505
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Watch it!

506
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,810
Baymax!

507
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,280
Baymax!

508
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,110
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

509
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,860
I have found where your tiny robot wants to go.

510
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,460
I told you, it's broken. It's not trying to go...

511
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,670
Locked.

512
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,890
There is a window.

513
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,840
Please exercise caution.

514
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,400
A fall from this height could lead to bodily harm.

515
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,380
Oh, no.

516
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,380
Excuse me while I let out some air.

517
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
Are you done?

518
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,350
Yes.

519
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,110
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

520
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,680
Fine, just keep it down.

521
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,570
My microbots?

522
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,120
Someone's making more.

523
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,340
Hiro?

524
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,750
You gave me a heart attack!

525
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,090
My hands are equipped with defibrillators. Clear.

526
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,920
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression.

527
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,300
Oh, no.

528
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,640
Run!

529
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,810
Oh, come on!

530
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,310
I am not fast.

531
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,940
Yeah, no kidding!

532
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,610
Go! Go! Come on.

533
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,030
Kick it down!

534
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,950
Then punch it!

535
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,130
Go! Go!

536
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,500
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

537
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Move it!

538
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,800
Come on!

539
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,320
No, no.

540
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,410
Come on! The window!

541
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,490
Suck it in!

542
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,340
Baymax!

543
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,000
Hiro?

544
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,100
Come on, let's get out of here.

545
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,020
Go! Hurry!

546
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,100
All right, let me get this straight.

547
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,200
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

548
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,520
with an army of miniature flying robots.

549
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,190
"Microbots."

550
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,370
-Microbots. -Yeah.

551
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,910
He was controlling them

552
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,280
telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter.

553
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,210
So, Mr. Kabuki was using esp

554
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,050
to attack you and balloon man.

555
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,820
Did you file a report when your flying robots were stolen?

556
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,090
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

557
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,620
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

558
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,330
but Baymax was there, too.

559
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,470
-Tell him. -Yes, officer.

560
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,420
He's telling the truth.

561
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,760
What the... What's wrong with you?

562
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,600
Low battery.

563
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,430
Try to keep it together.

564
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,610
I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion.

565
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,300
Kid, how about we call your parents,

566
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,610
and get them down here?

567
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,940
What?

568
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,690
Write your name and number down

569
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,290
on this piece of paper, and we can...

570
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,130
I've gotta get you home to your charging station.

571
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Can you walk?

572
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,120
I will scan you now. Scan complete.

573
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,680
Healthcare.

574
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Okay.

575
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,390
If my aunt asks, we were at school all day. Got it?

576
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,890
We jumped out a window.

577
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,780
No! Quiet!

578
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,660
We jumped out a window.

579
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,980
You can't say things like that around aunt Cass.

580
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,340
Hiro?

581
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,660
You home, sweetie?

582
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,680
That's right.

583
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,380
I thought I heard you.

584
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,670
Hey, aunt Cass.

585
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,010
Look at my little college man.

586
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,230
I can't wait to hear all about it!

587
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,510
And wings are almost ready.

588
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Whee!

589
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Will you be quiet?

590
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,680
Yeah, wings! Whee!

591
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,570
All right, get ready to have your face melted.

592
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,690
We are gonna feel these things tomorrow.

593
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,190
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Okay.

595
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,870
Sit down. Tell me everything.

596
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,630
The thing is that, since I registered so late,

597
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,120
I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.

598
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,580
What was that?

599
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,380
Mochi.

600
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,890
That darn cat.

601
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,560
At least take a plate for the road, okay?

602
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,890
-Don't work too... -Thanks for understanding.

603
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:39,060
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

604
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,360
All right, come on.

605
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm healthcare, your personal baymax companion.

606
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,690
One foot in front of the other.

607
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,680
This doesn't make any sense.

608
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,210
Tadashi.

609
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,340
What?

610
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,020
Tadashi.

611
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,980
Tadashi's gone.

612
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,400
When will he return?

613
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,820
He's dead, baymax.

614
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,660
Tadashi was in excellent health.

615
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,900
With a proper diet and exercise,

616
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,960
he should have lived a long life.

617
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,910
Yeah, he should have.

618
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,380
But there was a fire and...

619
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,540
Now, he's gone.

620
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,050
-Tadashi is here. -No.

621
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,680
People keep saying he's not really gone.

622
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,140
As long as we remember him.

623
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,640
It still hurts.

624
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,640
I see no evidence of physical injury.

625
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,570
It's a different kind of hurt.

626
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,870
You are my patient.

627
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,310
I would like to help.

628
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,480
You can't fix this one, buddy.

629
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,410
What are you doing?

630
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,740
I am downloading a database on personal loss.

631
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,450
Database downloaded.

632
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,050
Treatments include contact with friends and loved ones.

637
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,500
I am contacting them now.

638
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,170
No, no, no! I... Don't do that.

639
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,630
Your friends have been contacted.

640
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
Unbelievable.

641
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,430
Now, what are you doing?

642
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,390
Other treatments include compassion and physical reassurance.

643
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,900
I'm okay. Really.

644
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,140
You will be all right. There, there.

645
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,820
Thanks, Baymax.

646
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,450
I am sorry about the fire.

647
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,570
It's okay. It was an accident.

648
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,870
Unless...

649
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,210
Unless it wasn't.

650
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,700
At the showcase,

651
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,380
that guy in the mask stole my microbots. And...

652
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,090
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.

653
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,170
He's responsible for Tadashi.

654
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,600
We gotta catch that guy.

655
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,840
It's alive!

656
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,440
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!

657
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,810
If we're gonna catch that guy,

658
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,610
you need some upgrades.

659
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,770
Will apprehending the man

660
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,360
in the mask improve your emotional state?

661
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,190
Absolutely.

662
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,000
Let's work on your moves.

663
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,090
Now, let's take care of this.

664
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,040
I have some concerns.

665
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,060
This armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.

666
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,960
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

668
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,890
You look sick.

669
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,270
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

670
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,010
It's just an expression.

671
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,270
Data transfer complete.

673
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,330
I fail to see

674
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,920
how karate makes me a better healthcare companion.

675
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,590
You want to keep me healthy, don't you?

676
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,960
Punch this.

677
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,840
Yes! Hammerfist!

678
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,600
Side kick!

679
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,970
Knifehand!

680
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,610
Back kick!

681
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,690
Gummy bears!

682
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,120
Yes!

683
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,330
Yeah! Fist bump!

684
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,220
"Fist bump" Is not in my fighting database.

685
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,800
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

686
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,140
It's what people do sometimes

687
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,930
when they're excited or pumped up.

688
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,060
Hey, now you're getting it.

689
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,780
I will add "Fist bump" to my care-giving matrix.

690
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,280
All right. Let's go get that guy.

691
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,370
Come on!

692
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,350
Get him, Baymax!

693
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,780
We're too late.

694
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,520
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

695
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,450
Come on.

696
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,880
Always wait one hour after eating before swimming.

697
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,400
Come on!

698
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,320
Your heart rate has increased dramatic...

699
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,050
Okay, Baymax, time to use those upgrades.

700
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,440
-Hiro? -No, no, no!

701
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,890
Get out of here! Go!

702
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,640
Dude, what are you doing out here?

703
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,270
Nothing! Just out for a walk.

704
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,100
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

705
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,410
Is that Baymax?

706
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,150
Yeah, but you really...

707
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,940
Why is he wearing carbon fiber underpants?

708
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,750
I also know karate.

709
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,030
You guys need to go.

710
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,890
No, don't push us away, Hiro.

711
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,080
We're here for you.

712
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,750
That's why Baymax contacted us.

713
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,250
Those who suffer a loss,

714
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,670
require support from friends and loved ones.

715
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,870
Okay, but I...

716
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,800
Who would like to share their feelings first?

717
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,460
I'll go. Okay.

718
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,130
My name is Fred, and it has been 30 days since my last...

719
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,000
Holy mother of megazon!

720
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,930
Am I the only one seeing this?

721
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,220
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

722
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,060
Go!

723
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,610
Baymax, get him!

724
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,080
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

725
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,530
I'm saving your life.

726
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,900
Baymax can handle that guy!

727
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,490
Oh, no.

728
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,420
Wasabi!

729
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,130
Goodbye!

730
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,050
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

731
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,890
He stole my microbots. He started the fire.

732
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,510
I don't know who he is!

733
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,260
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

734
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,430
Hard left!

735
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,000
That mask, the black suit...

736
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,340
We're under attack from a super villain, people!

737
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,080
I mean, how cool is that?

738
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,370
I mean, it's scary, obviously. But how cool!

739
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,970
Why are we stopped?

740
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,010
The light's red!

741
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,640
There are no red lights in a car chase!

742
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,590
Why is he trying to kill us?

743
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,970
Why are you trying to kill us?

744
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,940
It's classic villain. We've seen too much!

745
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,320
Let's not jump to conclusions.

746
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,310
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

747
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,610
Car!

748
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,940
He's trying to kill us!

749
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,320
Did you just put your blinker on?

750
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,900
You have to indicate your turn!

751
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,190
It's the law!

752
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,250
That's it.

753
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,990
Stop the car!

754
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,320
Baymax and I can take this guy!

755
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,660
Seatbelts save lives.

756
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,290
Buckle up, every time.

757
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,000
What are you doing? What are you doing?

758
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,140
What are you doing? What are you doing?

759
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,850
-Did we lose him? -Look out!

760
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,440
Baymax, hold on!

761
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,040
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

762
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,400
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

763
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,240
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

764
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,250
We made it! Yes!

765
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,780
I told you we'd make it!

766
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
Your injuries require my attention.

767
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,250
And your body temperatures are low.

768
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,960
We should get out of here.

769
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,010
I know a place.

770
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,040
Where are we?

771
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,880
Fred.

772
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,350
Where are you going?

773
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,510
Welcome to mi casa.

775
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,360
That's French for "Front door."

776
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,180
It's really not.

777
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,530
Listen, nitwit.

778
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,190
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

779
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,810
I'm not in the mood for any...

780
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,480
Welcome home, master Frederick.

781
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,370
Heathcliff, my man!

782
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,820
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.

783
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,120
Gimme some.

784
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,960
Freddie,

785
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,970
this is your house?

786
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,920
I thought you lived under a bridge.

787
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,960
Well, technically, it belongs to my parents.

788
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,260
They're on a vacay on the family island.

789
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,840
You know, we should totally go some time. Frolic.

790
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,640
You gotta be kidding me.

792
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,490
If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask,

793
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,160
I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today.

794
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,410
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

795
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,990
Your body temperature is still low.

796
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,030
Yeah.

797
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,580
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

798
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,420
It's so nice.

799
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,300
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

800
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,090
Good robot.

801
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,900
Does this symbol mean anything to you guys?

802
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,060
-Yes! It's a bird! -No!

803
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,290
The guy in the mask was carrying something

804
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,520
with this symbol on it.

805
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,790
Apprehending the man in

806
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,860
the mask will improve Hiro's emotional state.

807
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,620
Apprehend him?

808
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,110
We don't even know who he is.

809
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,870
I have a theory.

810
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,920
"Dr. Slaughter, md"?

811
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,160
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

812
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,620
Malcolm chazzletick.

813
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,210
"The annihilator"?

814
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,920
Behind the mask, industrialist Reid Axworthy.

815
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,130
"Baron Von destruct"? Just get to the point!

816
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,460
Don't you guys get it?

817
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,930
The man in the mask who attacked us

818
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,480
is none other than...

819
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,220
Voila!

820
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,480
Alistair krei.

821
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,180
-What? -Think about it.

822
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,810
Krei wanted your microbots, and you said no.

823
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,430
But rules don't apply to a man like krei.

824
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,480
There's no way. The guy is too high profile.

825
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,530
Then who was that guy in the mask?

826
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,330
I don't know.

827
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,540
We don't know anything about him.

828
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,990
His blood type is ab-negative.

829
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,720
-Cholesterol levels are... - Baymax,

830
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,080
you scanned him?

831
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,920
I am programed to assess everyone's healthcare needs.

832
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,500
Yes!

833
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,040
I can use the data from your scan to find him.

834
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,830
You'd have to scan everyone in San fransokyo.

835
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,010
That might take, I don't know, forever.

836
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,530
No, no, no, no. I...

837
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,880
I just have to look for another angle.

838
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,510
Got it!

839
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,530
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

840
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,230
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

841
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,710
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

842
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,670
I need to upgrade all of you.

843
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,030
Upgrade who, now?

844
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,800
Those who suffer a loss

845
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,700
require support from friends and loved ones.

846
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,240
Okay, I like where this is heading!

847
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,910
We can't go against that guy! We're nerds!

848
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,270
Hiro, we want to help,

849
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,630
but we're just us.

850
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
No.

851
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,230
You can be way more.

852
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,840
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

853
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,960
We're in.

854
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,740
Can you feel it? You guys, do you feel this?

855
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,650
Our origin story begins.

856
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,740
We're gonna be superheroes!

857
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,060
Arms up.

858
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,430
The neurotransmitter must be in his mask.

859
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,820
We get the mask, and he can't control the bots.

860
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,980
Game over.

861
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,050
They say "We are what we are"

862
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,950
But we don't have to be

863
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,680
I'm bad behavior

864
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,710
But I do it in the best way

865
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,930
I'll be the watcher

866
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,100
Of the eternal flame

867
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,500
I'll be the guard dog

868
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,560
Of all your fever dreams

869
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,990
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass

870
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,540
Cause we could be immortals

871
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,300
Immortals

872
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,620
Just not for long for long

873
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,210
Live with me forever now

874
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,700
Pull the blackout curtains down

875
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,470
Just not for long for long

876
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,720
We could be immortals

877
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,520
Immortals

878
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,720
Immortals

879
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:46,320
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith

880
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,860
Is when it's tested again and again every day

881
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,330
I'm still comparing your past to my future

882
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,210
Cause we could be immortals

883
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,780
Immortals

884
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,250
Just not for long for long

885
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,250
Super jump!

886
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,550
Super jump!

887
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,050
Pull the blackout curtains down

888
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:13,970
-I breathe fire. -Just not for long for long

889
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,270
We could be immortals

890
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,780
Immortals

891
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:28,150
Immortals

892
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:32,910
Immortals

893
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,740
Immortals

894
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,220
I love it!

895
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,440
Not bad.

896
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,440
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

897
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,560
Hey, guys!

898
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,640
Check this out.

899
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,320
I'd like to introduce,

900
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,050
Baymax 2.0.

901
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,950
He's glorious.

902
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,590
Hold up. Focus.

903
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,010
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

904
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,430
The fist, show them the fist.

905
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,600
No, not that.

906
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,520
The thing, the other thing.

907
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,870
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

908
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,400
That's just one of his new upgrades!

909
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,330
Baymax, wings.

910
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,170
No way!

911
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,800
Thrusters.

912
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,440
I fail to see how flying

913
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,690
makes me a better healthcare companion.

914
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,770
I fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome!

915
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,310
Full thrust.

916
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,740
Steady, big guy.

917
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,660
Look, let's just take this slow.

918
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,830
Up, up, up, up, up!

919
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,240
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

920
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,040
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

921
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,660
Too much thrust!

922
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
No, no, no, no!

923
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,620
Back on! Back on!

924
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,310
On! On! On!

925
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,320
Go up! Up, up, up!

926
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,970
Oh, man!

927
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,330
Maybe... Maybe enough flying for today.

928
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
What do you say?

929
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,160
Your neurotransmitter levels are rising steadily.

930
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,650
Which means what?

931
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,290
The treatment is working.

932
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,820
Oh, no!

933
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,410
No, no, no, no, no!

934
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,760
Whoa, Baymax!

935
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,090
Yes!

936
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,290
That was...

937
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,410
That was...

938
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,080
Sick.

939
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,290
It is just an expression.

940
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,540
That's... that's right, buddy.

941
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:21,380
I am never taking the bus again.

942
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,430
Your emotional state has improved.

943
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,470
I can deactivate if you say you are satisfied with your care.

944
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,400
What?

945
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,240
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

946
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,910
We still have to find that guy.

947
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,030
So, fire up that super-sensor.

948
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,210
Functionality improved.

949
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,280
1000% increase in range.

950
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,840
I have found a match,

951
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,970
on that island.

952
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,590
-Killer view. -Yeah. If I...

953
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,760
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

954
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,050
I'd probably love this.

955
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,520
But I'm terrified of heights, so I don't love it.

956
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,240
There. Baymax, take us in.

957
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,820
Awesome!

958
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,280
Our first landing together as a team.

959
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,240
Guys, come on.

960
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,500
"Quarantine"?

961
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,410
Do you people know what "Quarantine" Means?

962
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,480
"Quarantine."

963
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,940
Enforced isolation to prevent contamination

964
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,980
that could lead to disease, or, in some cases, death.

965
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,210
There's a skull face on this one.

966
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,420
A skull face!

967
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,800
Be ready.

968
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,840
He could be anywhere.

969
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,060
Fire!

970
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,360
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

971
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,410
That was a bird.

972
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,950
Well, at least we know our gear works.

973
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,100
Six intrepid friends

974
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,520
Led by Fred

975
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,350
Their leader, Fred

976
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,850
Fred's angels

977
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,430
Fred's angels

978
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,370
Harnessing the power of the sun with the

979
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,190
Ancient amulet they found in the attic

980
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,730
The amulet is green

981
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,210
It's probably an emerald

982
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,660
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.

983
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,290
Guys, Shhhh...

984
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,200
Any sign of him, Baymax?

985
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,420
This structure is interfering with my sensor.

986
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,170
Perfect. The robot's broken.

987
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,640
Guys, you might want to see this.

988
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,010
What do you think it is, genius?

989
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,860
I'm not sure. But look.

990
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,610
Hiro.

991
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,260
Krei.

992
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:57,860
That's right.

993
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,400
We were asked to do the impossible.

994
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
That's what we did.

995
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:06,450
We've reinvented the very concept of transportation.

996
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:11,150
Friends, I present project Silent Sparrow.

997
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,930
General, may I?

998
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,720
Magic hat!

999
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,740
Teleportation.

1000
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,120
The transport of matter instantaneously through space.

1001
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,260
Not science fiction anymore.

1002
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:45,960
Now, we didn't spend billions of tax dollars to teleport hats.

1003
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,860
Ladies and gentlemen, you're here to witness history.

1004
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,300
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?

1005
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,620
We've invited all these people.

1006
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,360
Might as well give 'em a show.

1007
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,850
T-minus 30 seconds to launch.

1008
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,580
-29, 28... -This is argo.

1009
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,420
-Capsule's in position. -27...

1010
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,980
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity

1011
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,810
in the magnetic containment field.

1012
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,210
Mr. Krei, is there a problem?

1013
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,810
No. No problem.

1014
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,420
It's well within the parameters.

1015
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,930
Let's move forward.

1016
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,930
3, 2, 1.

1017
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,610
Cabin pressure is go.

1018
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,640
Pod engaged.

1019
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,780
Field breach! Abort!

1020
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,160
We've lost all contact with the pod.

1021
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,540
Oh, no.

1022
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,550
-It's breaking up! -The pilot is gone.

1023
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,200
Portal two is down.

1024
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,370
The magnetic containment field's down!

1025
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,630
Krei, shut it down now!

1026
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,550
I want this island sealed off!

1027
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,390
The government shut down Krei's experiment.

1028
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,340
And he's using your microbots to steal his machine back.

1029
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,480
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1030
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,350
Oh, no.

1031
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,620
Baymax, get us out of here.

1032
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,990
Go for the transmitter.

1033
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,660
Behind his mask.

1034
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,550
Baymax!

1035
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,660
All right, what's the plan?

1036
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,220
It's Fred time.

1037
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,290
Super jump!

1038
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,970
Gravity crush!

1039
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,500
Falling hard.

1040
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,350
Seriously, what is the plan?

1041
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,890
-Get the mask. -Right behind you.

1042
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,100
For real, what is the plan?

1043
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,010
Hey!

1044
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,900
You want to dance, masked man?

1045
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,780
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.

1046
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,900
Hand over the mask, or you'll get a taste of this!

1047
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,160
And a little bit of that!

1048
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,580
Hey! I did all right.

1049
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,670
Is that all you got?

1050
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,250
You got that, too?

1051
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,420
It's back into the fire!

1052
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,240
It's over, Krei.

1053
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,380
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1054
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,790
The explosion...

1055
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,130
You died.

1056
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,800
No. I had your microbots.

1057
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,800
But, Tadashi.

1058
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,070
You just let him die.

1059
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,480
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1060
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,110
He went in there to save you!

1061
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,650
That was his mistake!

1062
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,790
Baymax, destroy.

1063
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,250
My programing prevents me from injuring a human being.

1064
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,700
Not anymore.

1065
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,630
Hiro, this is not what...

1066
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,510
Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!

1067
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,010
No! Stop, Baymax!

1068
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,900
No, stop! He's getting away!

1069
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,740
Baymax!

1070
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,100
My healthcare protocol has been violated.

1071
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,870
I regret any distress I may have caused.

1072
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,360
How could you do that? I had him!

1073
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,360
What you just did, we never signed up for.

1074
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,710
We said we'd catch the guy.

1075
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:31,950
That's it.

1076
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,080
I never should have let you help me!

1077
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,040
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1078
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,220
My enhanced scanner has been damaged.

1079
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,670
Wings.

1080
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,050
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1081
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,550
Fly!

1082
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,340
Hiro!

1083
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,740
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1084
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,170
You appear to be distressed.

1085
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,870
I'm fine!

1086
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,870
There. Is it working?

1087
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,800
- My sensor is operational. - Good.

1088
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,590
Then let's get...

1089
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,290
What?

1090
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,600
Are you going to remove my healthcare chip?

1091
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,420
Yes. Open!

1092
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,510
My purpose is to heal the sick and injured.

1093
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,680
Baymax, open your access port.

1094
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,470
Do you want me to terminate Professor Callaghan?

1095
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,610
Just open!

1096
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,670
Will terminating Professor Callaghan

1097
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,520
improve your emotional state?

1098
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,910
Yes! No! I don't know!

1099
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,150
Open your access!

1100
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,660
- Is this what Tadashi wanted? - It doesn't matter!

1101
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,080
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1102
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,460
Tadashi's gone!

1103
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,380
Tadashi's gone.

1104
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,510
Tadashi is here.

1105
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,050
No. He's not here.

1106
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,090
Tadashi is here.

1107
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,090
This is Tadashi Hamada.

1108
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,940
And this is the first test of my robotics project.

1109
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,440
Hello, I am Baymax.

1110
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,240
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1111
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,370
The seventh test of my robotics project.

1112
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,790
Hello, I...

1113
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,120
What? What?

1114
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,410
Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop scan! Stop...

1115
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,990
Tadashi Hamada again,

1116
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:43,420
and this is the 33rd test of my robotics project.

1117
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,100
I'm not giving up on you.

1118
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,880
You don't understand this yet, but people need you.

1119
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,730
So, let's get back to work.

1120
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,010
This is Tadashi Hamada,

1121
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,650
and this is the 84th test.

1122
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,450
What do you say, big guy?

1123
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,070
Hello, I am Baymax,

1124
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,160
your personal healthcare companion.

1125
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,440
It works.

1126
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,830
It works!

1127
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:17,500
This is amazing! You... you work!

1128
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,090
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.

1129
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,370
I knew it. Oh, you work. I can't believe it! I can't...

1130
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,010
Okay. All right, big moment, here.

1131
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,390
Scan me.

1132
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:32,310
Your neurotransmitter levels are elevated.

1133
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,590
This indicates that you are happy.

1134
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:37,140
I am. I really am.

1135
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,180
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.

1136
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,100
You're gonna help so many people, buddy.

1137
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,850
So many.

1138
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,730
That's all for now. I am satisfied with my care.

1139
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,790
Thank you, Baymax.

1140
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,840
I'm so sorry.

1141
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,540
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1142
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,550
Hiro.

1143
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,060
Guys, I, I...

1144
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,980
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1145
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,360
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1146
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,290
But maybe don't leave your team

1147
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,240
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1148
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,240
- Oh, man. - Nah, it's cool.

1149
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,460
Heathcliff picked us up in the family chopper.

1150
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,410
Hiro, we found something you should see.

1151
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,750
You almost got us all killed!

1152
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,090
Krei! You did this!

1153
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,040
You knew it wasn't ready!

1154
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,970
Callaghan? He was there?

1155
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,270
He was such a good man. What happened?

1156
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,730
I don't know.

1157
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,690
But the answer's here somewhere.

1158
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,350
Wait, wait! Stop.

1159
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,140
There he is.

1160
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
With the pilot.

1161
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:11,400
Hang on.

1162
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,480
We've invited all these people...

1164
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,740
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1165
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,950
Callaghan blames Krei.

1166
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,570
This is a revenge story.

1167
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,670
So, what are we waiting for?

1168
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,670
It's all set up.

1169
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:38,340
This beautiful new campus is the culmination of a lifelong dream.

1170
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:41,130
But none of this would've been possible

1171
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,600
without a few bumps in the road.

1172
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:47,670
Those setbacks made us stronger,

1174
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,530
and set us on the path to a bright future.

1175
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,110
What is that?

1176
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,600
- What? - Setback?

1177
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,490
Was my daughter a "Setback"?

1178
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,920
Callaghan! But you...

1179
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,010
Your daughter, that...

1180
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,500
That was an accident.

1181
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,540
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1182
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,270
My daughter is gone because of your arrogance.

1183
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,140
What are you doing?

1184
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,140
You took everything from me

1185
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,450
when you sent Abigail into that machine.

1186
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,250
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1187
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,580
No!

1188
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,330
No! No! You can't!

1189
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,060
You're going to watch everything you've built disappear.

1190
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,810
Then, it's your turn.

1191
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,670
Professor Callaghan!

1192
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,320
Let him go!

1193
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,280
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1194
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,190
Abigail is gone!

1195
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,530
This won't change anything. Trust me, I know.

1196
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,400
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1197
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,620
Please, let me go.

1198
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,790
I'll give you anything you want!

1199
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,420
I want my daughter back!

1200
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,290
Go for the mask!

1201
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,570
Baymax!

1202
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,230
Leaping into action!

1203
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,680
Oh, no!

1204
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,510
Getting a little... A little tight.

1205
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,780
- No! - He's too strong!

1206
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,130
- There's no way out! - You can't beat him!

1207
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,620
Help! I can't beat him.

1208
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,050
Hiro!

1209
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,470
- Hiro? Hiro? - Help!

1210
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,180
- That's it! - Hiro.

1211
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,590
- I know how to beat him. - Hiro.

1212
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,640
Listen up!

1213
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,050
Use those big brains of yours,

1214
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,600
and think your way around the problem.

1215
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,170
Look for a new angle.

1216
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,230
My arms! They can't go any further!

1217
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,750
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1218
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,620
Hello, sign.

1219
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,120
Care to go for a little spin?

1220
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,750
Double spin!

1221
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:36,910
Behind-the-back spin!

1222
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,770
Baymax!

1223
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,780
Hiro.

1224
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,130
I love that robot!

1225
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,130
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.

1226
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,560
Take out the bots. They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1227
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,230
Now that is a plan!

1228
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,430
Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover?

1229
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,400
Like you have to ask.

1230
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,640
Let's do this, Freddie!

1231
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,610
Smokescreen!

1232
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,150
Ready and

1233
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,250
dive!

1234
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,210
Whoa, the gravity's getting a little weird here, guys!

1235
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,760
Wait. Let's use this!

1236
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,850
These are green blades of fury!

1237
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,800
Woman up!

1238
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,890
Double sign-spin.

1239
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,280
Now my signs are on fire!

1240
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,630
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1241
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:45,220
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1242
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,750
Hammerfist.

1243
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,380
This ends now!

1244
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,070
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1245
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,310
What?

1246
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,410
Baymax!

1247
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,240
No!

1248
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,210
Our programing prevents us from injuring a human being.

1249
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,800
But we'll take that.

1250
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,540
It's still on! We have to shut it down!

1251
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,000
We can't! The containment field is failing.

1252
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,420
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1253
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,290
We need to get out of here, now!

1254
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,970
Baymax!

1255
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,350
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1256
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,380
- What? - Coming from there.

1257
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,310
The life signs are female.

1258
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,730
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1259
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,070
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.

1260
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,610
Abigail.

1261
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,440
Let's go get her.

1262
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,320
The portal is destabilizing. You'll never make it.

1263
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:36,490
She's alive in there.

1264
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,370
Someone has to help.

1265
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,280
What do you say, buddy?

1266
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,160
Flying makes me a better healthcare companion.

1267
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,940
Careful! There's Krei tech debris everywhere.

1268
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,120
Look out!

1269
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,430
I have located the patient.

1270
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,680
Hurry!

1271
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,920
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1272
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,540
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1273
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,090
Veer right!

1274
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,020
Okay, to the left.

1275
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,230
Hard right!

1276
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,680
Up and over.

1277
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,270
Okay, level off. Easy.

1278
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,440
Nice flying!

1279
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,360
Almost there!

1280
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,630
Baymax!

1281
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:00,220
Baymax!

1282
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,300
My thrusters are inoperable.

1283
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,430
Just grab hold.

1284
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:24,400
There is still a way I can get you both to safety.

1285
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,330
I cannot deactivate until you say

1286
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,450
you are satisfied with your care.

1287
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,950
No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you?

1288
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,830
- You are my patient. - Baymax.

1289
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,420
Your health is my only concern.

1290
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,170
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1291
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,920
Are you satisfied with your care?

1292
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,850
No. There's gotta be another way.

1293
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,970
I'm not gonna leave you here. I'll think of something.

1294
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,520
There is no time.

1295
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,430
Are you satisfied with your care?

1296
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,140
Please! No.

1297
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,320
I can't lose you, too.

1298
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,780
Hiro, I will always be with you.

1299
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,890
I'm satisfied with my care.

1300
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,930
Hiro!

1301
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,100
Yeah! They made it!

1302
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,060
Baymax?

1303
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:31,750
Miss, can you hear me?

1304
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,460
What is your name?

1305
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,570
Abigail Callaghan.

1306
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,380
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.

1307
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,800
We're taking you to the hospital.

1308
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,040
Move it!

1309
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,550
Get in there.

1310
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,150
A massive cleanup continues today

1311
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,320
at the headquarters of Krei Tech Industries.

1313
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:06,730
Reports are still flooding in

1314
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,830
about a group of unidentified individuals,

1315
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,110
who prevented what could have been a major catastrophe.

1316
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,820
The whole city of San Fransokyo is asking,

1317
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,320
"Who are these heroes? And where are they now?"

1318
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,080
It's so exciting.

1319
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:22,510
Hey, sweetie!

1320
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,760
Okay.

1321
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,340
Last hug.

1322
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:31,680
Bye!

1323
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,340
- And just then I was like... - Get out of here.

1324
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,720
I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.

1325
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,530
Hello, Hiro.

1326
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,700
We didn't set out to be superheroes,

1327
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:43,080
but sometimes life doesn't go the way you planned.

1328
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,260
The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people,

1329
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,000
and that's what we're gonna do.

1330
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,720
Who are we?

1334
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:26,440
Dad, I just wish I could share my accomplishments with you.

1335
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:28,450
You mean so much to me, and honestly,

1336
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,940
I've always felt a distance

1337
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:33,360
what with you being on the family island all the time,

1338
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,730
and I just wish you could see how...

1339
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,130
Fred.

1340
01:40:58,970 --> 01:40:59,970
Son.

1341
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:01,940
Dad?

1342
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:08,310
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.

1343
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:13,620
I go inside out, then I go front and back.

1344
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:14,990
Dad!

1345
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,290
We have a lot to talk about.

2
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,980
Get up! Get up!

3
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,460
The winner,

4
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,720
by total annihilation,

5
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,680
Yama!

6
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,020
Who is next?

7
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Who has the guts to step into the ring with little Yama?

8
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,180
Yama!

9
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,730
Can I try?

10
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,150
I have a robot. I built it myself.

11
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,120
Beat it, kid.

12
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,040
House rules. You gotta pay to play.

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,500
Is this enough?

14
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,540
What's your name, little boy?

15
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,340
Hiro. Hiro Hamada.

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,090
Prepare your bot, zero.

17
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,560
Two bots enter,

18
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,860
one bot leaves.

19
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,990
Fighters ready?

20
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,270
Fight!

21
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,340
That was my first fight. I... Can I try again?

22
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,370
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

23
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,250
Go home.

24
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,870
I've got more money.

25
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,340
Fighters ready?

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,980
Fight!

27
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,260
Mega-bot, destroy.

28
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,820
What?

29
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,630
- No more little Yama. - But, wha...

30
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,420
This is not possible!

31
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,230
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

32
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,800
Beginner's luck.

33
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,310
Do you want to go again, Yama?

34
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,280
No one hustles Yama!

35
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,860
Teach him a lesson.

36
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,980
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.

37
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,950
- Hiro! Get on! - Tadashi!

38
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,620
Good timing!

39
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,830
Oh, mama!

40
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,540
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,890
- Are you hurt? - No.

42
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,010
Then what were you thinking, knucklehead?

43
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,770
You graduated high school when you were 13,

44
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,890
and this is what you're doing?

45
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
There they are!

46
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,530
Hold on!

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,770
Yes!

48
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,310
Get back here.

49
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,440
Bot fighting is illegal.

50
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,240
You're going to get yourself arrested.

51
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Bot fighting is not illegal.

52
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,910
Betting on bot fighting, that's... that's illegal.

53
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,170
But so lucrative!

54
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,630
I'm on a roll, big brother! And there is no stopping me!

55
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Oh, no.

57
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,980
Hi, Aunt Cass.

58
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,050
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.

59
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,610
- We're fine. - We're okay.

60
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,930
Oh, good.

61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,030
Then what were you two knuckleheads thinking?

62
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
For 10 years,

63
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,660
I have done the best I could to raise you.

64
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,520
Have I been perfect? No.

65
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,580
Do I know anything about children? No.

66
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,490
Should I have picked up a book on parenting?

67
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,830
Probably!

68
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,120
Where was I going with this? I had a point.

69
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,380
- Sorry. - We love you, Aunt Cass.

70
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,910
Well, I love you, too!

71
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,010
I had to close up early because of you two felons.

72
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,290
On beat poetry night.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,090
Stress eating. Because of you.

74
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,340
Come on, Mochi.

75
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,470
This is really good!

76
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,820
You better make this up to Aunt Cass

77
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,340
before she eats everything in the cafe.

78
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,640
For sure.

79
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,940
And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.

80
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,970
Absolutely.

81
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,860
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

82
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,320
There's a fight across town. If I book, I can still make it.

83
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,730
When are you gonna

84
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,780
start doing something with that big brain of yours?

85
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,700
What? Go to college like you?

86
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,580
So people can tell me stuff I already know?

87
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,420
Unbelievable.

88
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,030
What would mom and dad say?

89
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,300
I don't know.

90
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,010
They're gone.

91
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,380
They died when I was three, remember?

92
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,130
- I'll take you. - Really?

93
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,420
I can't stop you from going,

94
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,880
but I'm not going to let you go on your own.

95
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,190
Sweet.

97
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,860
What are we doing at your nerd school?

98
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,560
Bot-fight's that way!

100
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,110
Gotta grab something.

101
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,810
Is this gonna take long?

102
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,280
Relax, you big baby. We'll be in and out.

103
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,910
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,750
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

105
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,990
Heads up!

106
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,640
Electro-mag suspension?

107
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,270
- Who are you? - I'm...

108
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,350
Go go, this is my brother Hiro.

109
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,990
Welcome to the nerd lab.

110
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Yeah.

111
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,660
I've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.

112
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,330
Zero resistance, faster bike.

113
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,160
But, not fast enough,

114
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,710
yet.

115
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,170
Do not move. Behind the line, please.

116
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,970
Hey, Wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.

117
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,560
Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.

118
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,630
Catch.

119
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,610
- Laser-induced plasma? - Oh, yeah.

120
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,610
With a little magnetic confinement for ultra-precision.

121
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,820
Wow. How do you find anything in this mess?

122
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,820
I have a system.

123
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,950
There's a place for everything,

124
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,900
and everything in its place.

125
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,410
- Need this! - You can't do that!

126
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,610
This is anarchy! Society has rules!

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,460
Excuse me!

128
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,070
Coming through!

129
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,740
Tadashi!

130
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,870
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

131
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I've heard so much about you!

132
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,290
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

133
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,890
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

134
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,630
400 pounds of it!

135
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,960
Come here, come here, come here.

136
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,760
You're going to love this.

137
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,050
A dash of perchloric acid, a smidge of cobalt,

138
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,730
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

139
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,350
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...

140
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,810
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

141
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,360
It's so pink.

142
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,280
Here's the best part.

143
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,040
I know, right?

144
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,410
Chemical metal embrittlement.

145
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,050
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

146
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,830
"Honey Lemon"? "Go go"? "Wasabi"?

147
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,050
I spill wasabi on my shirt one time, people.

148
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,510
One time!

149
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,810
Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.

150
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,350
Who's Fred?

151
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,930
This guy, right here!

152
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,650
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,190
This is not my real face and body.

154
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,470
The name's Fred.

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,520
School mascot by day, but by night,

156
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,650
I am also a school mascot.

157
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,200
So, what's your major?

158
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,740
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

159
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,910
But I am a major science enthusiast.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,120
I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula,

161
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,250
that can turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will.

162
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,660
But she says that's "Not science."

163
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,910
It's really not.

164
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,630
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

165
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,590
I asked Wasabi for isn't "Science" either.

166
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,790
- Is it? - Nope.

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,630
Well, then, what about "Invisible sandwich"?

168
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,840
- Hiro. - Imagine eating a sandwich,

169
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,920
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

170
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,050
Just stop.

171
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,340
- Laser eyes? - What?

172
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,220
- Tingly fingers? - Never gonna happen.

173
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,470
Hey, what about a growth serum?

174
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,610
So, what have you been working on?

175
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,930
I'll show you.

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,060
Duct tape?

177
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,020
I hate to break it to you, bro.

178
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,310
Already been invented.

179
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,870
Dude!

180
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Ow!

181
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,170
This is what I've been working on.

182
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
Hello. I am Baymax.

183
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,240
Your personal healthcare companion.

184
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,700
I was alerted to the need

185
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,160
for medical attention when you said, "Ow."

186
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,440
A robotic nurse.

187
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,490
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

188
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,490
Physical or emotional?

189
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,790
I will scan you now.

190
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,160
Scan complete.

191
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,880
You have a slight epidermal abrasion on your forearm.

192
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,590
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

193
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,260
What's in the spray, specifically?

194
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,350
The primary ingredient is Bacitracin.

195
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,020
That's a bummer. I'm actually allergic to that.

196
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,110
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

197
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,650
You do have a mild allergy to peanuts.

198
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,350
Not bad.

199
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,030
You've done some serious coding on this thing, huh?

200
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,150
Programed him with over 10,000 medical procedures.

202
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,830
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.

203
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,670
Vinyl?

204
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,960
Yeah, going for a non-threatening, huggable kind of thing.

205
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,170
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

206
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,800
- No offense. - I am a robot.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,210
I cannot be offended.

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,390
- Hyperspectral cameras? -Yep.

209
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,100
- Titanium skeleton? - Carbon fiber.

210
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,440
Right. Even lighter.

211
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,890
Killer actuators. Where did you get those?

212
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,640
Machined them right here, in-house.

213
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,030
- Really? - Yup.

214
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,690
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

215
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Shut up.

216
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,520
You have been a good boy. Have a lollipop.

217
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,870
Nice.

218
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,090
I cannot deactivate until you say

219
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,450
you are satisfied with your care.

220
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,450
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

221
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,580
He's going to help a lot of people.

222
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,700
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

223
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Lithium ion.

224
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,720
You know, supercapacitors would charge way faster.

225
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,960
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?

226
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,050
Hey, Professor.

227
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,090
Actually, I was just finishing up.

228
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,390
You must be Hiro.

229
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,050
Bot-fighter, right?

230
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,900
When my daughter was younger, that's all she wanted to do.

231
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,140
May I?

232
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,600
Sure.

233
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,070
Magnetic-bearing servos.

234
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,450
Pretty sick, huh?

235
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,770
Wanna see how I put 'em together?

236
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,330
Hey, genius!

237
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,280
He invented them.

238
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,740
You're Robert Callaghan?

239
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,570
Like, as in,

240
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,450
the Callaghan-catmull spline,

241
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,080
and Callaghan's "Laws of robotics"?

242
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,290
That's right.

243
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,120
Ever think about applying here?

244
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,670
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

245
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I don't know.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,250
He's pretty serious about his career in bot-fighting.

247
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,750
Well, kind of serious.

248
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,970
I can see why.

249
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,090
With your bot, winning must come easy.

250
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,010
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,200
Well, if you like things easy,

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,520
then my program isn't for you.

253
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,020
We push the boundaries of robotics here.

254
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,650
My students go on to shape the future.

255
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,450
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

256
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,030
Good luck with the bot-fights.

257
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,950
We gotta hurry if you want to catch that bot-fight.

258
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,750
I have to go here.

259
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,460
If I don't go to this nerd school,

260
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,830
I'm gonna lose my mind.

261
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
How do I get in?

263
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,220
Every year, the school has a student showcase.

264
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,200
You come up with something that blows Callaghan away,

265
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,930
you're in.

266
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,720
But, it's gotta be great.

268
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,140
Trust me.

269
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,300
It will be.

270
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,730
Nothing!

271
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,990
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!

272
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,330
Wow. Washed up at 14.

273
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,450
So sad.

274
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,330
I got nothing! I'm done. I'm never getting in.

275
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,340
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.

276
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,380
What are you doing?

277
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,840
Shake things up.

278
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,340
Use that big brain of yours to think your way out.

279
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,510
- What? - Look for a new angle.

280
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,210
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.

281
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,550
How are you feeling?

282
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,380
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.

283
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,230
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

284
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,440
Yep, he's nervous.

285
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,890
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

286
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,730
- He's so tense. - No, I'm not.

287
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,400
Relax, Hiro.

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,310
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go go.

289
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,040
Stop whining. Woman up.

290
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm fine!

291
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,560
What do you need, little man? Deodorant? Breath mint?

292
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Fresh pair of underpants?

293
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,790
Underpants? You need serious help.

294
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey, I come prepared.

295
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,110
I haven't done laundry in six months.

296
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,420
One pair lasts me four days.

297
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,570
I go front, I go back,

298
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,740
I go inside-out. Then I go front and back.

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,170
Wow. That is both disgusting and awesome.

300
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,510
Don't encourage him.

301
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,080
It's called "Recycling."

302
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,850
Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.

303
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,800
Oh, yeah. This is it.

304
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,970
I guess I'm up.

305
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,260
Okay, photo, photo! Everybody say, "Hiro."

306
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,840
- Hiro! - Yeah!

307
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,600
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

308
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,190
- Don't mess it up. - Break a leg, little man.

309
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,820
Science, yeah!

310
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,100
All right, bro. This is it.

311
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,700
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

312
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,780
What's going on?

313
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,330
I really want to go here.

314
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
You got this.

315
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,290
My name is Hiro...

316
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,930
Sorry.

317
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,770
My name is Hiro Hamada,

318
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,310
and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool.

319
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,310
I hope you like it.

320
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,150
This is a microbot.

321
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,460
Breathe.

322
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,660
It doesn't look like much,

323
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,040
but when it links up with the rest of its pals,

324
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,510
things get a little more interesting.

325
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,910
The microbots are controlled with this neural transmitter.

326
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,530
I think what I want them to do...

327
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,580
They do it.

328
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,870
The applications for this tech are limitless.

329
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,510
Construction.

330
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,340
What used to take teams of people working by hand

331
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,760
for months or years,

332
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,560
can now be accomplished by one person.

333
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,050
And that's just the beginning.

334
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,760
How about transportation?

335
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,390
Microbots can move anything anywhere,

336
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,200
with ease.

337
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,580
If you can think it, the microbots can do it.

338
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
The only limit is your imagination.

339
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,930
Microbots!

340
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,390
That's my nephew!

341
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,690
Yes!

342
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,480
My family! I love my family!

343
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,270
Nailed it!

344
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,270
- You did it! - Not bad!

345
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,280
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!

346
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,770
They loved you. That was amazing!

347
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,280
Yes.

348
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,580
With some development, your tech could be revolutionary.

349
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,820
Alistair Krei!

350
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,460
May I?

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,130
Extraordinary.

352
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,470
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

353
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,170
Shut up.

354
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,830
Mr. Krei is right.

355
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,840
Your microbots are an inspired piece of tech.

356
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,630
You can continue to develop them,

357
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,310
or you can sell them to a man

358
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,520
who's only guided by his own self-interest.

359
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,440
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

360
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,680
but it shouldn't affect...

361
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,470
This is your decision, Hiro.

362
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,690
But you should know

363
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,650
Mr. Krei has cut corners and ignored sound science

364
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
to get where he is.

365
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,150
That's just not true.

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,060
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech

367
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,870
with your microbots,

368
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,500
or anything else.

369
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,420
Hiro, I'm offering you

370
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,030
more money than any 14-year-old could imagine.

371
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,060
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,

372
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,460
but they're not for sale.

373
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,390
I thought you were smarter than that.

374
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,960
Robert.

375
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,060
Mr. Krei.

376
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,390
That's my brother's.

377
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,860
That's right.

378
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,200
I look forward to seeing you in class.

379
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,870
Unbelievable!

380
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,150
That's what I'm talking about.

381
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,960
All right, geniuses,

382
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,370
let's feed those hungry brains.

383
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Back to the cafe!

384
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,880
Dinner is on me!

385
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,880
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

386
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,870
- Aunt Cass? - Unless it's moldy.

387
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,370
We'll... we'll catch up, okay?

388
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,720
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

389
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,590
Both of you.

390
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,930
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

391
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,270
I know what you're going to say.

392
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,190
"I should be proud of myself,"

393
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,110
"because I'm finally using my gift for something important."

394
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,270
No, no. I was just gonna

395
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,030
tell you your fly was down for the whole show.

396
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,110
Ha-ha-hilarious.

397
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,080
What?

398
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,130
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

399
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,450
Hey, I...

400
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,430
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. So,

401
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,430
you know,

402
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,430
thanks for not giving up on me.

403
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,100
Are you okay?

404
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,780
Yeah. I'm okay.

405
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,570
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.

406
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,440
Tadashi, no!

407
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,420
Callaghan's in there.

408
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,790
Someone has to help.

409
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,810
Tadashi!

410
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,480
Tadashi!

411
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,040
Here. Have some tea.

412
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,240
Hey, sweetie.

413
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,690
Hey, Aunt Cass.

414
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,620
Mrs. Matsuda's in the cafe.

415
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,080
She's wearing something super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.

416
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,410
That always cracks you up.

417
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,580
You should come down.

418
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,960
Maybe later.

419
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,050
The university called again.

420
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,290
It's been a few weeks since classes started.

421
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,710
But they said it's not too late to register.

422
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,470
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.

424
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,950
Hey, Hiro.

425
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,820
We just wanted to check in, and see how you're doing.

426
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,090
We wish you were here, buddy.

427
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,120
Hiro, if I could have only one superpower right now,

428
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,670
it would be the ability to crawl through this camera,

429
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,130
and give you a big hug.

430
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Ow!

431
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,060
Hello. I am Baymax,

432
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,020
your personal healthcare companion.

433
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,020
Hey, Baymax.

434
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,860
I didn't know you were still active.

435
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,030
I heard a sound of distress.

436
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,650
What seems to be the trouble?

437
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,750
I just stubbed my toe a little.

438
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm fine.

439
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,200
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

440
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,210
A zero. I'm okay, really.

441
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,290
Thanks. You can shrink now.

442
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,970
Does it hurt when I touch it?

443
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,930
That's okay. No touching.

444
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,590
I'm fine...

445
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,050
You have fallen.

446
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,230
You think?

447
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,740
- On a scale of 1 to... - Ow!

448
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,100
On a scale...

449
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,270
On a sca...

450
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,620
On a scale of 1 to 10...

451
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,280
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

452
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,080
Zero.

453
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,450
- It is all right to cry. - No. No, no, no, no.

454
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,240
Crying is a natural response to pain.

455
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,410
I'm not crying.

456
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,910
- I will scan you for injuries. - Don't scan me.

457
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,750
- Scan complete. - Unbelievable.

458
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,760
You have sustained no injuries.

459
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,420
However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels

460
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,420
indicate that you are experiencing mood swings,

461
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,800
common in adolescence.

462
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,420
Diagnosis, puberty.

463
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,770
What?

464
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,350
Okay. Time to shrink now.

465
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,470
You should expect an increase in body hair,

466
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,110
especially on your face, chest, armpits, and...

467
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,490
Thank you! That's enough.

468
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,270
You may also experience strange and powerful new urges.

469
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,280
Okay! Let's get you back in your luggage.

470
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,510
I cannot deactivate until you say

471
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,450
you are satisfied with your care.

472
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,120
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

473
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,470
My microbot?

474
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,960
This doesn't make any sense.

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,430
Puberty can often be a confusing time

476
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,650
for a young adolescent flowering into manhood.

477
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,640
No. The thing is attracted to the other microbots,

478
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,640
but that's impossible.

479
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,810
They were destroyed in the fire.

480
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,990
Dumb thing's broken.

481
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,160
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

482
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,340
Oh, yeah?

483
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,010
Why don't you find out where it's trying to go?

484
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,660
Would that stabilize your pubescent mood swings?

485
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,220
Absolutely.

486
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,180
Baymax?

487
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,350
Baymax?

488
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,650
Baymax?

489
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,410
What?

490
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,540
- Hiro? - Hey, Aunt Cass!

491
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,910
Wow. You're up and...

492
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,870
Yeah! I figured it was time.

493
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,910
Are you registering for school?

494
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Yes.

495
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,950
I thought about what you said. Really inspired me.

496
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,380
Oh, honey, that's so great.

497
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,880
Okay,

498
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,300
special dinner tonight.

499
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,800
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

500
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,390
You know, with the hot sauce that makes our faces numb.

501
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,220
- Okay, sounds good. - Great!

502
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,890
Last hug.

503
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,070
Baymax!

504
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,240
Baymax!

505
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Watch it!

506
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,810
Baymax!

507
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,280
Baymax!

508
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,110
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

509
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,860
I have found where your tiny robot wants to go.

510
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,460
I told you, it's broken. It's not trying to go...

511
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,670
Locked.

512
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,890
There is a window.

513
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,840
Please exercise caution.

514
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,400
A fall from this height could lead to bodily harm.

515
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,380
Oh, no.

516
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,380
Excuse me while I let out some air.

517
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
Are you done?

518
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,350
Yes.

519
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,110
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

520
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,680
Fine, just keep it down.

521
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,570
My microbots?

522
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,120
Someone's making more.

523
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,340
Hiro?

524
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,750
You gave me a heart attack!

525
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,090
My hands are equipped with defibrillators. Clear.

526
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,920
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression.

527
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,300
Oh, no.

528
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,640
Run!

529
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,810
Oh, come on!

530
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,310
I am not fast.

531
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,940
Yeah, no kidding!

532
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,610
Go! Go! Come on.

533
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,030
Kick it down!

534
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,950
Then punch it!

535
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,130
Go! Go!

536
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,500
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

537
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Move it!

538
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,800
Come on!

539
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,320
No, no.

540
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,410
Come on! The window!

541
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,490
Suck it in!

542
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,340
Baymax!

543
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,000
Hiro?

544
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,100
Come on, let's get out of here.

545
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,020
Go! Hurry!

546
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,100
All right, let me get this straight.

547
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,200
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

548
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,520
with an army of miniature flying robots.

549
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,190
"Microbots."

550
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,370
-Microbots. -Yeah.

551
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,910
He was controlling them

552
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,280
telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter.

553
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,210
So, Mr. Kabuki was using esp

554
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,050
to attack you and balloon man.

555
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,820
Did you file a report when your flying robots were stolen?

556
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,090
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

557
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,620
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

558
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,330
but Baymax was there, too.

559
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,470
-Tell him. -Yes, officer.

560
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,420
He's telling the truth.

561
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,760
What the... What's wrong with you?

562
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,600
Low battery.

563
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,430
Try to keep it together.

564
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,610
I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion.

565
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,300
Kid, how about we call your parents,

566
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,610
and get them down here?

567
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,940
What?

568
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,690
Write your name and number down

569
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,290
on this piece of paper, and we can...

570
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,130
I've gotta get you home to your charging station.

571
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Can you walk?

572
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,120
I will scan you now. Scan complete.

573
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,680
Healthcare.

574
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Okay.

575
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,390
If my aunt asks, we were at school all day. Got it?

576
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,890
We jumped out a window.

577
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,780
No! Quiet!

578
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,660
We jumped out a window.

579
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,980
You can't say things like that around aunt Cass.

580
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,340
Hiro?

581
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,660
You home, sweetie?

582
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,680
That's right.

583
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,380
I thought I heard you.

584
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,670
Hey, aunt Cass.

585
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,010
Look at my little college man.

586
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,230
I can't wait to hear all about it!

587
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,510
And wings are almost ready.

588
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Whee!

589
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Will you be quiet?

590
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,680
Yeah, wings! Whee!

591
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,570
All right, get ready to have your face melted.

592
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,690
We are gonna feel these things tomorrow.

593
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,190
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Okay.

595
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,870
Sit down. Tell me everything.

596
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,630
The thing is that, since I registered so late,

597
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,120
I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.

598
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,580
What was that?

599
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,380
Mochi.

600
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,890
That darn cat.

601
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,560
At least take a plate for the road, okay?

602
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,890
-Don't work too... -Thanks for understanding.

603
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:39,060
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

604
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,360
All right, come on.

605
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm healthcare, your personal baymax companion.

606
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,690
One foot in front of the other.

607
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,680
This doesn't make any sense.

608
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,210
Tadashi.

609
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,340
What?

610
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,020
Tadashi.

611
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,980
Tadashi's gone.

612
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,400
When will he return?

613
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,820
He's dead, baymax.

614
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,660
Tadashi was in excellent health.

615
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,900
With a proper diet and exercise,

616
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,960
he should have lived a long life.

617
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,910
Yeah, he should have.

618
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,380
But there was a fire and...

619
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,540
Now, he's gone.

620
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,050
-Tadashi is here. -No.

621
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,680
People keep saying he's not really gone.

622
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,140
As long as we remember him.

623
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,640
It still hurts.

624
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,640
I see no evidence of physical injury.

625
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,570
It's a different kind of hurt.

626
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,870
You are my patient.

627
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,310
I would like to help.

628
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,480
You can't fix this one, buddy.

629
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,410
What are you doing?

630
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,740
I am downloading a database on personal loss.

631
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,450
Database downloaded.

632
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,050
Treatments include contact with friends and loved ones.

637
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,500
I am contacting them now.

638
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,170
No, no, no! I... Don't do that.

639
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,630
Your friends have been contacted.

640
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
Unbelievable.

641
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,430
Now, what are you doing?

642
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,390
Other treatments include compassion and physical reassurance.

643
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,900
I'm okay. Really.

644
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,140
You will be all right. There, there.

645
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,820
Thanks, Baymax.

646
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,450
I am sorry about the fire.

647
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,570
It's okay. It was an accident.

648
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,870
Unless...

649
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,210
Unless it wasn't.

650
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,700
At the showcase,

651
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,380
that guy in the mask stole my microbots. And...

652
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,090
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.

653
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,170
He's responsible for Tadashi.

654
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,600
We gotta catch that guy.

655
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,840
It's alive!

656
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,440
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!

657
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,810
If we're gonna catch that guy,

658
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,610
you need some upgrades.

659
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,770
Will apprehending the man

660
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,360
in the mask improve your emotional state?

661
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,190
Absolutely.

662
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,000
Let's work on your moves.

663
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,090
Now, let's take care of this.

664
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,040
I have some concerns.

665
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,060
This armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.

666
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,960
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

668
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,890
You look sick.

669
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,270
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

670
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,010
It's just an expression.

671
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,270
Data transfer complete.

673
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,330
I fail to see

674
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,920
how karate makes me a better healthcare companion.

675
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,590
You want to keep me healthy, don't you?

676
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,960
Punch this.

677
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,840
Yes! Hammerfist!

678
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,600
Side kick!

679
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,970
Knifehand!

680
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,610
Back kick!

681
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,690
Gummy bears!

682
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,120
Yes!

683
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,330
Yeah! Fist bump!

684
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,220
"Fist bump" Is not in my fighting database.

685
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,800
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

686
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,140
It's what people do sometimes

687
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,930
when they're excited or pumped up.

688
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,060
Hey, now you're getting it.

689
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,780
I will add "Fist bump" to my care-giving matrix.

690
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,280
All right. Let's go get that guy.

691
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,370
Come on!

692
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,350
Get him, Baymax!

693
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,780
We're too late.

694
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,520
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

695
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,450
Come on.

696
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,880
Always wait one hour after eating before swimming.

697
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,400
Come on!

698
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,320
Your heart rate has increased dramatic...

699
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,050
Okay, Baymax, time to use those upgrades.

700
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,440
-Hiro? -No, no, no!

701
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,890
Get out of here! Go!

702
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,640
Dude, what are you doing out here?

703
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,270
Nothing! Just out for a walk.

704
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,100
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

705
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,410
Is that Baymax?

706
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,150
Yeah, but you really...

707
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,940
Why is he wearing carbon fiber underpants?

708
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,750
I also know karate.

709
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,030
You guys need to go.

710
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,890
No, don't push us away, Hiro.

711
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,080
We're here for you.

712
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,750
That's why Baymax contacted us.

713
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,250
Those who suffer a loss,

714
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,670
require support from friends and loved ones.

715
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,870
Okay, but I...

716
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,800
Who would like to share their feelings first?

717
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,460
I'll go. Okay.

718
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,130
My name is Fred, and it has been 30 days since my last...

719
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,000
Holy mother of megazon!

720
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,930
Am I the only one seeing this?

721
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,220
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

722
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,060
Go!

723
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,610
Baymax, get him!

724
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,080
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

725
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,530
I'm saving your life.

726
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,900
Baymax can handle that guy!

727
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,490
Oh, no.

728
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,420
Wasabi!

729
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,130
Goodbye!

730
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,050
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

731
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,890
He stole my microbots. He started the fire.

732
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,510
I don't know who he is!

733
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,260
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

734
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,430
Hard left!

735
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,000
That mask, the black suit...

736
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,340
We're under attack from a super villain, people!

737
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,080
I mean, how cool is that?

738
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,370
I mean, it's scary, obviously. But how cool!

739
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,970
Why are we stopped?

740
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,010
The light's red!

741
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,640
There are no red lights in a car chase!

742
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,590
Why is he trying to kill us?

743
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,970
Why are you trying to kill us?

744
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,940
It's classic villain. We've seen too much!

745
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,320
Let's not jump to conclusions.

746
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,310
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

747
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,610
Car!

748
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,940
He's trying to kill us!

749
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,320
Did you just put your blinker on?

750
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,900
You have to indicate your turn!

751
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,190
It's the law!

752
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,250
That's it.

753
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,990
Stop the car!

754
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,320
Baymax and I can take this guy!

755
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,660
Seatbelts save lives.

756
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,290
Buckle up, every time.

757
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,000
What are you doing? What are you doing?

758
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,140
What are you doing? What are you doing?

759
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,850
-Did we lose him? -Look out!

760
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,440
Baymax, hold on!

761
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,040
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

762
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,400
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

763
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,240
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

764
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,250
We made it! Yes!

765
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,780
I told you we'd make it!

766
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
Your injuries require my attention.

767
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,250
And your body temperatures are low.

768
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,960
We should get out of here.

769
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,010
I know a place.

770
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,040
Where are we?

771
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,880
Fred.

772
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,350
Where are you going?

773
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,510
Welcome to mi casa.

775
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,360
That's French for "Front door."

776
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,180
It's really not.

777
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,530
Listen, nitwit.

778
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,190
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

779
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,810
I'm not in the mood for any...

780
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,480
Welcome home, master Frederick.

781
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,370
Heathcliff, my man!

782
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,820
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.

783
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,120
Gimme some.

784
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,960
Freddie,

785
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,970
this is your house?

786
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,920
I thought you lived under a bridge.

787
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,960
Well, technically, it belongs to my parents.

788
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,260
They're on a vacay on the family island.

789
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,840
You know, we should totally go some time. Frolic.

790
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,640
You gotta be kidding me.

792
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,490
If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask,

793
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,160
I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today.

794
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,410
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

795
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,990
Your body temperature is still low.

796
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,030
Yeah.

797
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,580
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

798
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,420
It's so nice.

799
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,300
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

800
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,090
Good robot.

801
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,900
Does this symbol mean anything to you guys?

802
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,060
-Yes! It's a bird! -No!

803
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,290
The guy in the mask was carrying something

804
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,520
with this symbol on it.

805
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,790
Apprehending the man in

806
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,860
the mask will improve Hiro's emotional state.

807
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,620
Apprehend him?

808
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,110
We don't even know who he is.

809
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,870
I have a theory.

810
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,920
"Dr. Slaughter, md"?

811
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,160
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

812
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,620
Malcolm chazzletick.

813
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,210
"The annihilator"?

814
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,920
Behind the mask, industrialist Reid Axworthy.

815
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,130
"Baron Von destruct"? Just get to the point!

816
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,460
Don't you guys get it?

817
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,930
The man in the mask who attacked us

818
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,480
is none other than...

819
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,220
Voila!

820
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,480
Alistair krei.

821
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,180
-What? -Think about it.

822
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,810
Krei wanted your microbots, and you said no.

823
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,430
But rules don't apply to a man like krei.

824
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,480
There's no way. The guy is too high profile.

825
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,530
Then who was that guy in the mask?

826
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,330
I don't know.

827
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,540
We don't know anything about him.

828
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,990
His blood type is ab-negative.

829
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,720
-Cholesterol levels are... - Baymax,

830
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,080
you scanned him?

831
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,920
I am programed to assess everyone's healthcare needs.

832
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,500
Yes!

833
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,040
I can use the data from your scan to find him.

834
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,830
You'd have to scan everyone in San fransokyo.

835
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,010
That might take, I don't know, forever.

836
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,530
No, no, no, no. I...

837
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,880
I just have to look for another angle.

838
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,510
Got it!

839
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,530
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

840
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,230
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

841
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,710
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

842
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,670
I need to upgrade all of you.

843
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,030
Upgrade who, now?

844
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,800
Those who suffer a loss

845
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,700
require support from friends and loved ones.

846
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,240
Okay, I like where this is heading!

847
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,910
We can't go against that guy! We're nerds!

848
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,270
Hiro, we want to help,

849
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,630
but we're just us.

850
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
No.

851
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,230
You can be way more.

852
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,840
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

853
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,960
We're in.

854
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,740
Can you feel it? You guys, do you feel this?

855
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,650
Our origin story begins.

856
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,740
We're gonna be superheroes!

857
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,060
Arms up.

858
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,430
The neurotransmitter must be in his mask.

859
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,820
We get the mask, and he can't control the bots.

860
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,980
Game over.

861
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,050
They say "We are what we are"

862
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,950
But we don't have to be

863
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,680
I'm bad behavior

864
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,710
But I do it in the best way

865
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,930
I'll be the watcher

866
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,100
Of the eternal flame

867
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,500
I'll be the guard dog

868
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,560
Of all your fever dreams

869
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,990
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass

870
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,540
Cause we could be immortals

871
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,300
Immortals

872
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,620
Just not for long for long

873
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,210
Live with me forever now

874
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,700
Pull the blackout curtains down

875
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,470
Just not for long for long

876
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,720
We could be immortals

877
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,520
Immortals

878
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,720
Immortals

879
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:46,320
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith

880
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,860
Is when it's tested again and again every day

881
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,330
I'm still comparing your past to my future

882
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,210
Cause we could be immortals

883
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,780
Immortals

884
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,250
Just not for long for long

885
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,250
Super jump!

886
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,550
Super jump!

887
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,050
Pull the blackout curtains down

888
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:13,970
-I breathe fire. -Just not for long for long

889
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,270
We could be immortals

890
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,780
Immortals

891
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:28,150
Immortals

892
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:32,910
Immortals

893
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,740
Immortals

894
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,220
I love it!

895
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,440
Not bad.

896
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,440
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

897
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,560
Hey, guys!

898
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,640
Check this out.

899
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,320
I'd like to introduce,

900
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,050
Baymax 2.0.

901
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,950
He's glorious.

902
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,590
Hold up. Focus.

903
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,010
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

904
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,430
The fist, show them the fist.

905
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,600
No, not that.

906
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,520
The thing, the other thing.

907
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,870
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

908
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,400
That's just one of his new upgrades!

909
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,330
Baymax, wings.

910
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,170
No way!

911
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,800
Thrusters.

912
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,440
I fail to see how flying

913
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,690
makes me a better healthcare companion.

914
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,770
I fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome!

915
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,310
Full thrust.

916
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,740
Steady, big guy.

917
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,660
Look, let's just take this slow.

918
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,830
Up, up, up, up, up!

919
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,240
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

920
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,040
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

921
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,660
Too much thrust!

922
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
No, no, no, no!

923
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,620
Back on! Back on!

924
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,310
On! On! On!

925
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,320
Go up! Up, up, up!

926
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,970
Oh, man!

927
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,330
Maybe... Maybe enough flying for today.

928
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
What do you say?

929
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,160
Your neurotransmitter levels are rising steadily.

930
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,650
Which means what?

931
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,290
The treatment is working.

932
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,820
Oh, no!

933
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,410
No, no, no, no, no!

934
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,760
Whoa, Baymax!

935
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,090
Yes!

936
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,290
That was...

937
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,410
That was...

938
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,080
Sick.

939
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,290
It is just an expression.

940
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,540
That's... that's right, buddy.

941
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:21,380
I am never taking the bus again.

942
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,430
Your emotional state has improved.

943
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,470
I can deactivate if you say you are satisfied with your care.

944
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,400
What?

945
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,240
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

946
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,910
We still have to find that guy.

947
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,030
So, fire up that super-sensor.

948
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,210
Functionality improved.

949
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,280
1000% increase in range.

950
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,840
I have found a match,

951
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,970
on that island.

952
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,590
-Killer view. -Yeah. If I...

953
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,760
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

954
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,050
I'd probably love this.

955
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,520
But I'm terrified of heights, so I don't love it.

956
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,240
There. Baymax, take us in.

957
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,820
Awesome!

958
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,280
Our first landing together as a team.

959
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,240
Guys, come on.

960
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,500
"Quarantine"?

961
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,410
Do you people know what "Quarantine" Means?

962
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,480
"Quarantine."

963
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,940
Enforced isolation to prevent contamination

964
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,980
that could lead to disease, or, in some cases, death.

965
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,210
There's a skull face on this one.

966
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,420
A skull face!

967
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,800
Be ready.

968
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,840
He could be anywhere.

969
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,060
Fire!

970
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,360
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

971
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,410
That was a bird.

972
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,950
Well, at least we know our gear works.

973
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,100
Six intrepid friends

974
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,520
Led by Fred

975
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,350
Their leader, Fred

976
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,850
Fred's angels

977
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,430
Fred's angels

978
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,370
Harnessing the power of the sun with the

979
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,190
Ancient amulet they found in the attic

980
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,730
The amulet is green

981
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,210
It's probably an emerald

982
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,660
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.

983
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,290
Guys, Shhhh...

984
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,200
Any sign of him, Baymax?

985
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,420
This structure is interfering with my sensor.

986
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,170
Perfect. The robot's broken.

987
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,640
Guys, you might want to see this.

988
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,010
What do you think it is, genius?

989
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,860
I'm not sure. But look.

990
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,610
Hiro.

991
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,260
Krei.

992
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:57,860
That's right.

993
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,400
We were asked to do the impossible.

994
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
That's what we did.

995
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:06,450
We've reinvented the very concept of transportation.

996
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:11,150
Friends, I present project Silent Sparrow.

997
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,930
General, may I?

998
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,720
Magic hat!

999
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,740
Teleportation.

1000
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,120
The transport of matter instantaneously through space.

1001
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,260
Not science fiction anymore.

1002
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:45,960
Now, we didn't spend billions of tax dollars to teleport hats.

1003
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,860
Ladies and gentlemen, you're here to witness history.

1004
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,300
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?

1005
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,620
We've invited all these people.

1006
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,360
Might as well give 'em a show.

1007
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,850
T-minus 30 seconds to launch.

1008
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,580
-29, 28... -This is argo.

1009
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,420
-Capsule's in position. -27...

1010
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,980
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity

1011
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,810
in the magnetic containment field.

1012
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,210
Mr. Krei, is there a problem?

1013
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,810
No. No problem.

1014
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,420
It's well within the parameters.

1015
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,930
Let's move forward.

1016
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,930
3, 2, 1.

1017
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,610
Cabin pressure is go.

1018
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,640
Pod engaged.

1019
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,780
Field breach! Abort!

1020
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,160
We've lost all contact with the pod.

1021
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,540
Oh, no.

1022
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,550
-It's breaking up! -The pilot is gone.

1023
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,200
Portal two is down.

1024
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,370
The magnetic containment field's down!

1025
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,630
Krei, shut it down now!

1026
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,550
I want this island sealed off!

1027
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,390
The government shut down Krei's experiment.

1028
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,340
And he's using your microbots to steal his machine back.

1029
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,480
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1030
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,350
Oh, no.

1031
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,620
Baymax, get us out of here.

1032
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,990
Go for the transmitter.

1033
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,660
Behind his mask.

1034
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,550
Baymax!

1035
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,660
All right, what's the plan?

1036
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,220
It's Fred time.

1037
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,290
Super jump!

1038
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,970
Gravity crush!

1039
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,500
Falling hard.

1040
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,350
Seriously, what is the plan?

1041
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,890
-Get the mask. -Right behind you.

1042
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,100
For real, what is the plan?

1043
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,010
Hey!

1044
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,900
You want to dance, masked man?

1045
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,780
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.

1046
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,900
Hand over the mask, or you'll get a taste of this!

1047
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,160
And a little bit of that!

1048
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,580
Hey! I did all right.

1049
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,670
Is that all you got?

1050
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,250
You got that, too?

1051
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,420
It's back into the fire!

1052
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,240
It's over, Krei.

1053
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,380
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1054
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,790
The explosion...

1055
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,130
You died.

1056
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,800
No. I had your microbots.

1057
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,800
But, Tadashi.

1058
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,070
You just let him die.

1059
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,480
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1060
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,110
He went in there to save you!

1061
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,650
That was his mistake!

1062
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,790
Baymax, destroy.

1063
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,250
My programing prevents me from injuring a human being.

1064
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,700
Not anymore.

1065
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,630
Hiro, this is not what...

1066
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,510
Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!

1067
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,010
No! Stop, Baymax!

1068
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,900
No, stop! He's getting away!

1069
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,740
Baymax!

1070
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,100
My healthcare protocol has been violated.

1071
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,870
I regret any distress I may have caused.

1072
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,360
How could you do that? I had him!

1073
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,360
What you just did, we never signed up for.

1074
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,710
We said we'd catch the guy.

1075
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:31,950
That's it.

1076
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,080
I never should have let you help me!

1077
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,040
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1078
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,220
My enhanced scanner has been damaged.

1079
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,670
Wings.

1080
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,050
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1081
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,550
Fly!

1082
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,340
Hiro!

1083
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,740
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1084
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,170
You appear to be distressed.

1085
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,870
I'm fine!

1086
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,870
There. Is it working?

1087
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,800
- My sensor is operational. - Good.

1088
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,590
Then let's get...

1089
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,290
What?

1090
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,600
Are you going to remove my healthcare chip?

1091
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,420
Yes. Open!

1092
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,510
My purpose is to heal the sick and injured.

1093
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,680
Baymax, open your access port.

1094
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,470
Do you want me to terminate Professor Callaghan?

1095
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,610
Just open!

1096
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,670
Will terminating Professor Callaghan

1097
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,520
improve your emotional state?

1098
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,910
Yes! No! I don't know!

1099
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,150
Open your access!

1100
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,660
- Is this what Tadashi wanted? - It doesn't matter!

1101
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,080
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1102
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,460
Tadashi's gone!

1103
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,380
Tadashi's gone.

1104
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,510
Tadashi is here.

1105
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,050
No. He's not here.

1106
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,090
Tadashi is here.

1107
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,090
This is Tadashi Hamada.

1108
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,940
And this is the first test of my robotics project.

1109
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,440
Hello, I am Baymax.

1110
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,240
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1111
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,370
The seventh test of my robotics project.

1112
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,790
Hello, I...

1113
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,120
What? What?

1114
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,410
Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop scan! Stop...

1115
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,990
Tadashi Hamada again,

1116
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:43,420
and this is the 33rd test of my robotics project.

1117
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,100
I'm not giving up on you.

1118
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,880
You don't understand this yet, but people need you.

1119
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,730
So, let's get back to work.

1120
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,010
This is Tadashi Hamada,

1121
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,650
and this is the 84th test.

1122
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,450
What do you say, big guy?

1123
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,070
Hello, I am Baymax,

1124
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,160
your personal healthcare companion.

1125
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,440
It works.

1126
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,830
It works!

1127
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:17,500
This is amazing! You... you work!

1128
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,090
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.

1129
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,370
I knew it. Oh, you work. I can't believe it! I can't...

1130
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,010
Okay. All right, big moment, here.

1131
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,390
Scan me.

1132
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:32,310
Your neurotransmitter levels are elevated.

1133
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,590
This indicates that you are happy.

1134
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:37,140
I am. I really am.

1135
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,180
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.

1136
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,100
You're gonna help so many people, buddy.

1137
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,850
So many.

1138
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,730
That's all for now. I am satisfied with my care.

1139
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,790
Thank you, Baymax.

1140
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,840
I'm so sorry.

1141
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,540
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1142
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,550
Hiro.

1143
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,060
Guys, I, I...

1144
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,980
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1145
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,360
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1146
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,290
But maybe don't leave your team

1147
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,240
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1148
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,240
- Oh, man. - Nah, it's cool.

1149
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,460
Heathcliff picked us up in the family chopper.

1150
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,410
Hiro, we found something you should see.

1151
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,750
You almost got us all killed!

1152
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,090
Krei! You did this!

1153
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,040
You knew it wasn't ready!

1154
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,970
Callaghan? He was there?

1155
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,270
He was such a good man. What happened?

1156
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,730
I don't know.

1157
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,690
But the answer's here somewhere.

1158
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,350
Wait, wait! Stop.

1159
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,140
There he is.

1160
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
With the pilot.

1161
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:11,400
Hang on.

1162
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,480
We've invited all these people...

1164
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,740
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1165
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,950
Callaghan blames Krei.

1166
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,570
This is a revenge story.

1167
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,670
So, what are we waiting for?

1168
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,670
It's all set up.

1169
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:38,340
This beautiful new campus is the culmination of a lifelong dream.

1170
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:41,130
But none of this would've been possible

1171
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,600
without a few bumps in the road.

1172
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:47,670
Those setbacks made us stronger,

1174
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,530
and set us on the path to a bright future.

1175
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,110
What is that?

1176
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,600
- What? - Setback?

1177
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,490
Was my daughter a "Setback"?

1178
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,920
Callaghan! But you...

1179
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,010
Your daughter, that...

1180
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,500
That was an accident.

1181
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,540
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1182
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,270
My daughter is gone because of your arrogance.

1183
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,140
What are you doing?

1184
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,140
You took everything from me

1185
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,450
when you sent Abigail into that machine.

1186
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,250
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1187
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,580
No!

1188
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,330
No! No! You can't!

1189
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,060
You're going to watch everything you've built disappear.

1190
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,810
Then, it's your turn.

1191
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,670
Professor Callaghan!

1192
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,320
Let him go!

1193
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,280
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1194
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,190
Abigail is gone!

1195
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,530
This won't change anything. Trust me, I know.

1196
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,400
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1197
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,620
Please, let me go.

1198
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,790
I'll give you anything you want!

1199
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,420
I want my daughter back!

1200
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,290
Go for the mask!

1201
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,570
Baymax!

1202
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,230
Leaping into action!

1203
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,680
Oh, no!

1204
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,510
Getting a little... A little tight.

1205
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,780
- No! - He's too strong!

1206
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,130
- There's no way out! - You can't beat him!

1207
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,620
Help! I can't beat him.

1208
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,050
Hiro!

1209
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,470
- Hiro? Hiro? - Help!

1210
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,180
- That's it! - Hiro.

1211
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,590
- I know how to beat him. - Hiro.

1212
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,640
Listen up!

1213
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,050
Use those big brains of yours,

1214
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,600
and think your way around the problem.

1215
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,170
Look for a new angle.

1216
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,230
My arms! They can't go any further!

1217
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,750
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1218
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,620
Hello, sign.

1219
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,120
Care to go for a little spin?

1220
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,750
Double spin!

1221
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:36,910
Behind-the-back spin!

1222
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,770
Baymax!

1223
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,780
Hiro.

1224
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,130
I love that robot!

1225
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,130
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.

1226
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,560
Take out the bots. They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1227
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,230
Now that is a plan!

1228
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,430
Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover?

1229
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,400
Like you have to ask.

1230
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,640
Let's do this, Freddie!

1231
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,610
Smokescreen!

1232
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,150
Ready and

1233
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,250
dive!

1234
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,210
Whoa, the gravity's getting a little weird here, guys!

1235
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,760
Wait. Let's use this!

1236
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,850
These are green blades of fury!

1237
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,800
Woman up!

1238
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,890
Double sign-spin.

1239
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,280
Now my signs are on fire!

1240
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,630
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1241
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:45,220
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1242
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,750
Hammerfist.

1243
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,380
This ends now!

1244
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,070
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1245
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,310
What?

1246
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,410
Baymax!

1247
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,240
No!

1248
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,210
Our programing prevents us from injuring a human being.

1249
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,800
But we'll take that.

1250
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,540
It's still on! We have to shut it down!

1251
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,000
We can't! The containment field is failing.

1252
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,420
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1253
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,290
We need to get out of here, now!

1254
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,970
Baymax!

1255
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,350
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1256
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,380
- What? - Coming from there.

1257
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,310
The life signs are female.

1258
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,730
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1259
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,070
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.

1260
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,610
Abigail.

1261
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,440
Let's go get her.

1262
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,320
The portal is destabilizing. You'll never make it.

1263
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:36,490
She's alive in there.

1264
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,370
Someone has to help.

1265
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,280
What do you say, buddy?

1266
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,160
Flying makes me a better healthcare companion.

1267
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,940
Careful! There's Krei tech debris everywhere.

1268
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,120
Look out!

1269
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,430
I have located the patient.

1270
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,680
Hurry!

1271
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,920
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1272
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,540
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1273
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,090
Veer right!

1274
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,020
Okay, to the left.

1275
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,230
Hard right!

1276
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,680
Up and over.

1277
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,270
Okay, level off. Easy.

1278
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,440
Nice flying!

1279
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,360
Almost there!

1280
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,630
Baymax!

1281
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:00,220
Baymax!

1282
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,300
My thrusters are inoperable.

1283
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,430
Just grab hold.

1284
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:24,400
There is still a way I can get you both to safety.

1285
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,330
I cannot deactivate until you say

1286
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,450
you are satisfied with your care.

1287
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,950
No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you?

1288
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,830
- You are my patient. - Baymax.

1289
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,420
Your health is my only concern.

1290
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,170
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1291
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,920
Are you satisfied with your care?

1292
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,850
No. There's gotta be another way.

1293
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,970
I'm not gonna leave you here. I'll think of something.

1294
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,520
There is no time.

1295
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,430
Are you satisfied with your care?

1296
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,140
Please! No.

1297
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,320
I can't lose you, too.

1298
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,780
Hiro, I will always be with you.

1299
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,890
I'm satisfied with my care.

1300
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,930
Hiro!

1301
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,100
Yeah! They made it!

1302
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,060
Baymax?

1303
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:31,750
Miss, can you hear me?

1304
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,460
What is your name?

1305
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,570
Abigail Callaghan.

1306
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,380
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.

1307
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,800
We're taking you to the hospital.

1308
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,040
Move it!

1309
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,550
Get in there.

1310
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,150
A massive cleanup continues today

1311
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,320
at the headquarters of Krei Tech Industries.

1313
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:06,730
Reports are still flooding in

1314
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,830
about a group of unidentified individuals,

1315
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,110
who prevented what could have been a major catastrophe.

1316
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,820
The whole city of San Fransokyo is asking,

1317
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,320
"Who are these heroes? And where are they now?"

1318
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,080
It's so exciting.

1319
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:22,510
Hey, sweetie!

1320
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,760
Okay.

1321
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,340
Last hug.

1322
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:31,680
Bye!

1323
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,340
- And just then I was like... - Get out of here.

1324
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,720
I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.

1325
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,530
Hello, Hiro.

1326
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,700
We didn't set out to be superheroes,

1327
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:43,080
but sometimes life doesn't go the way you planned.

1328
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,260
The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people,

1329
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,000
and that's what we're gonna do.

1330
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,720
Who are we?

1334
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:26,440
Dad, I just wish I could share my accomplishments with you.

1335
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:28,450
You mean so much to me, and honestly,

1336
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,940
I've always felt a distance

1337
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:33,360
what with you being on the family island all the time,

1338
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,730
and I just wish you could see how...

1339
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,130
Fred.

1340
01:40:58,970 --> 01:40:59,970
Son.

1341
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:01,940
Dad?

1342
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:08,310
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.

1343
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:13,620
I go inside out, then I go front and back.

1344
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:14,990
Dad!

1345
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,290
We have a lot to talk about.

2
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,980
Get up! Get up!

3
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,460
The winner,

4
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,720
by total annihilation,

5
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,680
Yama!

6
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,020
Who is next?

7
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Who has the guts to step into the ring with little Yama?

8
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,180
Yama!

9
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,730
Can I try?

10
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,150
I have a robot. I built it myself.

11
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,120
Beat it, kid.

12
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,040
House rules. You gotta pay to play.

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,500
Is this enough?

14
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,540
What's your name, little boy?

15
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,340
Hiro. Hiro Hamada.

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,090
Prepare your bot, zero.

17
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,560
Two bots enter,

18
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,860
one bot leaves.

19
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,990
Fighters ready?

20
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,270
Fight!

21
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,340
That was my first fight. I... Can I try again?

22
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,370
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

23
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,250
Go home.

24
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,870
I've got more money.

25
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,340
Fighters ready?

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,980
Fight!

27
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,260
Mega-bot, destroy.

28
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,820
What?

29
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,630
- No more little Yama. - But, wha...

30
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,420
This is not possible!

31
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,230
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

32
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,800
Beginner's luck.

33
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,310
Do you want to go again, Yama?

34
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,280
No one hustles Yama!

35
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,860
Teach him a lesson.

36
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,980
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.

37
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,950
- Hiro! Get on! - Tadashi!

38
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,620
Good timing!

39
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,830
Oh, mama!

40
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,540
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,890
- Are you hurt? - No.

42
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,010
Then what were you thinking, knucklehead?

43
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,770
You graduated high school when you were 13,

44
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,890
and this is what you're doing?

45
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
There they are!

46
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,530
Hold on!

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,770
Yes!

48
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,310
Get back here.

49
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,440
Bot fighting is illegal.

50
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,240
You're going to get yourself arrested.

51
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Bot fighting is not illegal.

52
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,910
Betting on bot fighting, that's... that's illegal.

53
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,170
But so lucrative!

54
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,630
I'm on a roll, big brother! And there is no stopping me!

55
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Oh, no.

57
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,980
Hi, Aunt Cass.

58
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,050
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.

59
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,610
- We're fine. - We're okay.

60
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,930
Oh, good.

61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,030
Then what were you two knuckleheads thinking?

62
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
For 10 years,

63
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,660
I have done the best I could to raise you.

64
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,520
Have I been perfect? No.

65
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,580
Do I know anything about children? No.

66
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,490
Should I have picked up a book on parenting?

67
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,830
Probably!

68
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,120
Where was I going with this? I had a point.

69
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,380
- Sorry. - We love you, Aunt Cass.

70
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,910
Well, I love you, too!

71
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,010
I had to close up early because of you two felons.

72
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,290
On beat poetry night.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,090
Stress eating. Because of you.

74
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,340
Come on, Mochi.

75
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,470
This is really good!

76
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,820
You better make this up to Aunt Cass

77
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,340
before she eats everything in the cafe.

78
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,640
For sure.

79
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,940
And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.

80
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,970
Absolutely.

81
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,860
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

82
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,320
There's a fight across town. If I book, I can still make it.

83
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,730
When are you gonna

84
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,780
start doing something with that big brain of yours?

85
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,700
What? Go to college like you?

86
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,580
So people can tell me stuff I already know?

87
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,420
Unbelievable.

88
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,030
What would mom and dad say?

89
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,300
I don't know.

90
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,010
They're gone.

91
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,380
They died when I was three, remember?

92
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,130
- I'll take you. - Really?

93
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,420
I can't stop you from going,

94
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,880
but I'm not going to let you go on your own.

95
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,190
Sweet.

97
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,860
What are we doing at your nerd school?

98
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,560
Bot-fight's that way!

100
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,110
Gotta grab something.

101
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,810
Is this gonna take long?

102
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,280
Relax, you big baby. We'll be in and out.

103
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,910
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,750
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

105
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,990
Heads up!

106
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,640
Electro-mag suspension?

107
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,270
- Who are you? - I'm...

108
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,350
Go go, this is my brother Hiro.

109
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,990
Welcome to the nerd lab.

110
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Yeah.

111
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,660
I've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.

112
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,330
Zero resistance, faster bike.

113
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,160
But, not fast enough,

114
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,710
yet.

115
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,170
Do not move. Behind the line, please.

116
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,970
Hey, Wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.

117
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,560
Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.

118
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,630
Catch.

119
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,610
- Laser-induced plasma? - Oh, yeah.

120
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,610
With a little magnetic confinement for ultra-precision.

121
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,820
Wow. How do you find anything in this mess?

122
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,820
I have a system.

123
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,950
There's a place for everything,

124
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,900
and everything in its place.

125
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,410
- Need this! - You can't do that!

126
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,610
This is anarchy! Society has rules!

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,460
Excuse me!

128
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,070
Coming through!

129
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,740
Tadashi!

130
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,870
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

131
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I've heard so much about you!

132
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,290
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

133
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,890
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

134
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,630
400 pounds of it!

135
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,960
Come here, come here, come here.

136
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,760
You're going to love this.

137
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,050
A dash of perchloric acid, a smidge of cobalt,

138
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,730
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

139
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,350
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...

140
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,810
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

141
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,360
It's so pink.

142
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,280
Here's the best part.

143
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,040
I know, right?

144
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,410
Chemical metal embrittlement.

145
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,050
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

146
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,830
"Honey Lemon"? "Go go"? "Wasabi"?

147
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,050
I spill wasabi on my shirt one time, people.

148
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,510
One time!

149
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,810
Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.

150
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,350
Who's Fred?

151
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,930
This guy, right here!

152
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,650
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,190
This is not my real face and body.

154
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,470
The name's Fred.

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,520
School mascot by day, but by night,

156
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,650
I am also a school mascot.

157
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,200
So, what's your major?

158
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,740
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

159
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,910
But I am a major science enthusiast.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,120
I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula,

161
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,250
that can turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will.

162
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,660
But she says that's "Not science."

163
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,910
It's really not.

164
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,630
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

165
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,590
I asked Wasabi for isn't "Science" either.

166
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,790
- Is it? - Nope.

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,630
Well, then, what about "Invisible sandwich"?

168
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,840
- Hiro. - Imagine eating a sandwich,

169
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,920
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

170
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,050
Just stop.

171
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,340
- Laser eyes? - What?

172
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,220
- Tingly fingers? - Never gonna happen.

173
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,470
Hey, what about a growth serum?

174
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,610
So, what have you been working on?

175
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,930
I'll show you.

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,060
Duct tape?

177
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,020
I hate to break it to you, bro.

178
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,310
Already been invented.

179
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,870
Dude!

180
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Ow!

181
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,170
This is what I've been working on.

182
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
Hello. I am Baymax.

183
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,240
Your personal healthcare companion.

184
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,700
I was alerted to the need

185
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,160
for medical attention when you said, "Ow."

186
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,440
A robotic nurse.

187
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,490
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

188
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,490
Physical or emotional?

189
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,790
I will scan you now.

190
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,160
Scan complete.

191
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,880
You have a slight epidermal abrasion on your forearm.

192
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,590
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

193
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,260
What's in the spray, specifically?

194
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,350
The primary ingredient is Bacitracin.

195
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,020
That's a bummer. I'm actually allergic to that.

196
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,110
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

197
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,650
You do have a mild allergy to peanuts.

198
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,350
Not bad.

199
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,030
You've done some serious coding on this thing, huh?

200
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,150
Programed him with over 10,000 medical procedures.

202
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,830
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.

203
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,670
Vinyl?

204
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,960
Yeah, going for a non-threatening, huggable kind of thing.

205
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,170
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

206
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,800
- No offense. - I am a robot.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,210
I cannot be offended.

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,390
- Hyperspectral cameras? -Yep.

209
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,100
- Titanium skeleton? - Carbon fiber.

210
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,440
Right. Even lighter.

211
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,890
Killer actuators. Where did you get those?

212
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,640
Machined them right here, in-house.

213
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,030
- Really? - Yup.

214
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,690
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

215
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Shut up.

216
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,520
You have been a good boy. Have a lollipop.

217
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,870
Nice.

218
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,090
I cannot deactivate until you say

219
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,450
you are satisfied with your care.

220
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,450
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

221
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,580
He's going to help a lot of people.

222
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,700
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

223
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Lithium ion.

224
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,720
You know, supercapacitors would charge way faster.

225
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,960
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?

226
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,050
Hey, Professor.

227
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,090
Actually, I was just finishing up.

228
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,390
You must be Hiro.

229
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,050
Bot-fighter, right?

230
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,900
When my daughter was younger, that's all she wanted to do.

231
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,140
May I?

232
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,600
Sure.

233
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,070
Magnetic-bearing servos.

234
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,450
Pretty sick, huh?

235
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,770
Wanna see how I put 'em together?

236
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,330
Hey, genius!

237
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,280
He invented them.

238
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,740
You're Robert Callaghan?

239
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,570
Like, as in,

240
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,450
the Callaghan-catmull spline,

241
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,080
and Callaghan's "Laws of robotics"?

242
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,290
That's right.

243
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,120
Ever think about applying here?

244
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,670
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

245
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I don't know.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,250
He's pretty serious about his career in bot-fighting.

247
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,750
Well, kind of serious.

248
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,970
I can see why.

249
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,090
With your bot, winning must come easy.

250
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,010
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,200
Well, if you like things easy,

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,520
then my program isn't for you.

253
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,020
We push the boundaries of robotics here.

254
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,650
My students go on to shape the future.

255
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,450
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

256
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,030
Good luck with the bot-fights.

257
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,950
We gotta hurry if you want to catch that bot-fight.

258
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,750
I have to go here.

259
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,460
If I don't go to this nerd school,

260
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,830
I'm gonna lose my mind.

261
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
How do I get in?

263
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,220
Every year, the school has a student showcase.

264
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,200
You come up with something that blows Callaghan away,

265
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,930
you're in.

266
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,720
But, it's gotta be great.

268
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,140
Trust me.

269
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,300
It will be.

270
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,730
Nothing!

271
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,990
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!

272
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,330
Wow. Washed up at 14.

273
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,450
So sad.

274
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,330
I got nothing! I'm done. I'm never getting in.

275
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,340
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.

276
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,380
What are you doing?

277
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,840
Shake things up.

278
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,340
Use that big brain of yours to think your way out.

279
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,510
- What? - Look for a new angle.

280
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,210
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.

281
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,550
How are you feeling?

282
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,380
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.

283
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,230
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

284
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,440
Yep, he's nervous.

285
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,890
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

286
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,730
- He's so tense. - No, I'm not.

287
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,400
Relax, Hiro.

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,310
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go go.

289
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,040
Stop whining. Woman up.

290
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm fine!

291
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,560
What do you need, little man? Deodorant? Breath mint?

292
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Fresh pair of underpants?

293
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,790
Underpants? You need serious help.

294
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey, I come prepared.

295
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,110
I haven't done laundry in six months.

296
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,420
One pair lasts me four days.

297
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,570
I go front, I go back,

298
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,740
I go inside-out. Then I go front and back.

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,170
Wow. That is both disgusting and awesome.

300
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,510
Don't encourage him.

301
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,080
It's called "Recycling."

302
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,850
Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.

303
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,800
Oh, yeah. This is it.

304
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,970
I guess I'm up.

305
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,260
Okay, photo, photo! Everybody say, "Hiro."

306
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,840
- Hiro! - Yeah!

307
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,600
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

308
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,190
- Don't mess it up. - Break a leg, little man.

309
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,820
Science, yeah!

310
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,100
All right, bro. This is it.

311
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,700
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

312
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,780
What's going on?

313
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,330
I really want to go here.

314
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
You got this.

315
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,290
My name is Hiro...

316
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,930
Sorry.

317
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,770
My name is Hiro Hamada,

318
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,310
and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool.

319
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,310
I hope you like it.

320
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,150
This is a microbot.

321
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,460
Breathe.

322
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,660
It doesn't look like much,

323
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,040
but when it links up with the rest of its pals,

324
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,510
things get a little more interesting.

325
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,910
The microbots are controlled with this neural transmitter.

326
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,530
I think what I want them to do...

327
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,580
They do it.

328
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,870
The applications for this tech are limitless.

329
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,510
Construction.

330
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,340
What used to take teams of people working by hand

331
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,760
for months or years,

332
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,560
can now be accomplished by one person.

333
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,050
And that's just the beginning.

334
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,760
How about transportation?

335
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,390
Microbots can move anything anywhere,

336
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,200
with ease.

337
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,580
If you can think it, the microbots can do it.

338
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
The only limit is your imagination.

339
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,930
Microbots!

340
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,390
That's my nephew!

341
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,690
Yes!

342
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,480
My family! I love my family!

343
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,270
Nailed it!

344
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,270
- You did it! - Not bad!

345
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,280
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!

346
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,770
They loved you. That was amazing!

347
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,280
Yes.

348
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,580
With some development, your tech could be revolutionary.

349
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,820
Alistair Krei!

350
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,460
May I?

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,130
Extraordinary.

352
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,470
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

353
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,170
Shut up.

354
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,830
Mr. Krei is right.

355
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,840
Your microbots are an inspired piece of tech.

356
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,630
You can continue to develop them,

357
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,310
or you can sell them to a man

358
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,520
who's only guided by his own self-interest.

359
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,440
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

360
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,680
but it shouldn't affect...

361
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,470
This is your decision, Hiro.

362
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,690
But you should know

363
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,650
Mr. Krei has cut corners and ignored sound science

364
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
to get where he is.

365
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,150
That's just not true.

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,060
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech

367
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,870
with your microbots,

368
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,500
or anything else.

369
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,420
Hiro, I'm offering you

370
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,030
more money than any 14-year-old could imagine.

371
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,060
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,

372
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,460
but they're not for sale.

373
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,390
I thought you were smarter than that.

374
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,960
Robert.

375
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,060
Mr. Krei.

376
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,390
That's my brother's.

377
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,860
That's right.

378
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,200
I look forward to seeing you in class.

379
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,870
Unbelievable!

380
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,150
That's what I'm talking about.

381
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,960
All right, geniuses,

382
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,370
let's feed those hungry brains.

383
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Back to the cafe!

384
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,880
Dinner is on me!

385
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,880
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

386
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,870
- Aunt Cass? - Unless it's moldy.

387
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,370
We'll... we'll catch up, okay?

388
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,720
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

389
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,590
Both of you.

390
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,930
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

391
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,270
I know what you're going to say.

392
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,190
"I should be proud of myself,"

393
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,110
"because I'm finally using my gift for something important."

394
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,270
No, no. I was just gonna

395
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,030
tell you your fly was down for the whole show.

396
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,110
Ha-ha-hilarious.

397
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,080
What?

398
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,130
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

399
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,450
Hey, I...

400
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,430
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. So,

401
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,430
you know,

402
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,430
thanks for not giving up on me.

403
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,100
Are you okay?

404
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,780
Yeah. I'm okay.

405
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,570
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.

406
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,440
Tadashi, no!

407
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,420
Callaghan's in there.

408
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,790
Someone has to help.

409
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,810
Tadashi!

410
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,480
Tadashi!

411
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,040
Here. Have some tea.

412
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,240
Hey, sweetie.

413
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,690
Hey, Aunt Cass.

414
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,620
Mrs. Matsuda's in the cafe.

415
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,080
She's wearing something super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.

416
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,410
That always cracks you up.

417
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,580
You should come down.

418
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,960
Maybe later.

419
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,050
The university called again.

420
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,290
It's been a few weeks since classes started.

421
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,710
But they said it's not too late to register.

422
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,470
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.

424
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,950
Hey, Hiro.

425
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,820
We just wanted to check in, and see how you're doing.

426
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,090
We wish you were here, buddy.

427
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,120
Hiro, if I could have only one superpower right now,

428
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,670
it would be the ability to crawl through this camera,

429
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,130
and give you a big hug.

430
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Ow!

431
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,060
Hello. I am Baymax,

432
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,020
your personal healthcare companion.

433
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,020
Hey, Baymax.

434
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,860
I didn't know you were still active.

435
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,030
I heard a sound of distress.

436
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,650
What seems to be the trouble?

437
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,750
I just stubbed my toe a little.

438
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm fine.

439
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,200
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

440
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,210
A zero. I'm okay, really.

441
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,290
Thanks. You can shrink now.

442
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,970
Does it hurt when I touch it?

443
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,930
That's okay. No touching.

444
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,590
I'm fine...

445
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,050
You have fallen.

446
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,230
You think?

447
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,740
- On a scale of 1 to... - Ow!

448
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,100
On a scale...

449
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,270
On a sca...

450
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,620
On a scale of 1 to 10...

451
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,280
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

452
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,080
Zero.

453
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,450
- It is all right to cry. - No. No, no, no, no.

454
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,240
Crying is a natural response to pain.

455
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,410
I'm not crying.

456
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,910
- I will scan you for injuries. - Don't scan me.

457
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,750
- Scan complete. - Unbelievable.

458
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,760
You have sustained no injuries.

459
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,420
However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels

460
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,420
indicate that you are experiencing mood swings,

461
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,800
common in adolescence.

462
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,420
Diagnosis, puberty.

463
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,770
What?

464
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,350
Okay. Time to shrink now.

465
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,470
You should expect an increase in body hair,

466
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,110
especially on your face, chest, armpits, and...

467
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,490
Thank you! That's enough.

468
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,270
You may also experience strange and powerful new urges.

469
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,280
Okay! Let's get you back in your luggage.

470
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,510
I cannot deactivate until you say

471
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,450
you are satisfied with your care.

472
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,120
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

473
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,470
My microbot?

474
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,960
This doesn't make any sense.

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,430
Puberty can often be a confusing time

476
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,650
for a young adolescent flowering into manhood.

477
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,640
No. The thing is attracted to the other microbots,

478
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,640
but that's impossible.

479
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,810
They were destroyed in the fire.

480
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,990
Dumb thing's broken.

481
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,160
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

482
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,340
Oh, yeah?

483
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,010
Why don't you find out where it's trying to go?

484
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,660
Would that stabilize your pubescent mood swings?

485
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,220
Absolutely.

486
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,180
Baymax?

487
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,350
Baymax?

488
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,650
Baymax?

489
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,410
What?

490
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,540
- Hiro? - Hey, Aunt Cass!

491
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,910
Wow. You're up and...

492
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,870
Yeah! I figured it was time.

493
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,910
Are you registering for school?

494
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Yes.

495
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,950
I thought about what you said. Really inspired me.

496
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,380
Oh, honey, that's so great.

497
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,880
Okay,

498
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,300
special dinner tonight.

499
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,800
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

500
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,390
You know, with the hot sauce that makes our faces numb.

501
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,220
- Okay, sounds good. - Great!

502
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,890
Last hug.

503
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,070
Baymax!

504
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,240
Baymax!

505
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Watch it!

506
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,810
Baymax!

507
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,280
Baymax!

508
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,110
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

509
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,860
I have found where your tiny robot wants to go.

510
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,460
I told you, it's broken. It's not trying to go...

511
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,670
Locked.

512
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,890
There is a window.

513
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,840
Please exercise caution.

514
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,400
A fall from this height could lead to bodily harm.

515
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,380
Oh, no.

516
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,380
Excuse me while I let out some air.

517
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
Are you done?

518
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,350
Yes.

519
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,110
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

520
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,680
Fine, just keep it down.

521
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,570
My microbots?

522
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,120
Someone's making more.

523
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,340
Hiro?

524
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,750
You gave me a heart attack!

525
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,090
My hands are equipped with defibrillators. Clear.

526
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,920
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression.

527
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,300
Oh, no.

528
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,640
Run!

529
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,810
Oh, come on!

530
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,310
I am not fast.

531
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,940
Yeah, no kidding!

532
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,610
Go! Go! Come on.

533
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,030
Kick it down!

534
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,950
Then punch it!

535
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,130
Go! Go!

536
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,500
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

537
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Move it!

538
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,800
Come on!

539
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,320
No, no.

540
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,410
Come on! The window!

541
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,490
Suck it in!

542
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,340
Baymax!

543
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,000
Hiro?

544
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,100
Come on, let's get out of here.

545
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,020
Go! Hurry!

546
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,100
All right, let me get this straight.

547
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,200
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

548
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,520
with an army of miniature flying robots.

549
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,190
"Microbots."

550
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,370
-Microbots. -Yeah.

551
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,910
He was controlling them

552
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,280
telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter.

553
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,210
So, Mr. Kabuki was using esp

554
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,050
to attack you and balloon man.

555
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,820
Did you file a report when your flying robots were stolen?

556
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,090
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

557
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,620
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

558
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,330
but Baymax was there, too.

559
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,470
-Tell him. -Yes, officer.

560
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,420
He's telling the truth.

561
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,760
What the... What's wrong with you?

562
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,600
Low battery.

563
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,430
Try to keep it together.

564
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,610
I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion.

565
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,300
Kid, how about we call your parents,

566
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,610
and get them down here?

567
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,940
What?

568
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,690
Write your name and number down

569
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,290
on this piece of paper, and we can...

570
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,130
I've gotta get you home to your charging station.

571
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Can you walk?

572
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,120
I will scan you now. Scan complete.

573
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,680
Healthcare.

574
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Okay.

575
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,390
If my aunt asks, we were at school all day. Got it?

576
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,890
We jumped out a window.

577
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,780
No! Quiet!

578
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,660
We jumped out a window.

579
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,980
You can't say things like that around aunt Cass.

580
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,340
Hiro?

581
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,660
You home, sweetie?

582
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,680
That's right.

583
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,380
I thought I heard you.

584
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,670
Hey, aunt Cass.

585
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,010
Look at my little college man.

586
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,230
I can't wait to hear all about it!

587
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,510
And wings are almost ready.

588
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Whee!

589
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Will you be quiet?

590
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,680
Yeah, wings! Whee!

591
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,570
All right, get ready to have your face melted.

592
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,690
We are gonna feel these things tomorrow.

593
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,190
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Okay.

595
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,870
Sit down. Tell me everything.

596
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,630
The thing is that, since I registered so late,

597
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,120
I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.

598
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,580
What was that?

599
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,380
Mochi.

600
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,890
That darn cat.

601
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,560
At least take a plate for the road, okay?

602
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,890
-Don't work too... -Thanks for understanding.

603
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:39,060
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

604
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,360
All right, come on.

605
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm healthcare, your personal baymax companion.

606
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,690
One foot in front of the other.

607
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,680
This doesn't make any sense.

608
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,210
Tadashi.

609
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,340
What?

610
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,020
Tadashi.

611
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,980
Tadashi's gone.

612
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,400
When will he return?

613
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,820
He's dead, baymax.

614
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,660
Tadashi was in excellent health.

615
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,900
With a proper diet and exercise,

616
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,960
he should have lived a long life.

617
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,910
Yeah, he should have.

618
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,380
But there was a fire and...

619
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,540
Now, he's gone.

620
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,050
-Tadashi is here. -No.

621
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,680
People keep saying he's not really gone.

622
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,140
As long as we remember him.

623
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,640
It still hurts.

624
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,640
I see no evidence of physical injury.

625
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,570
It's a different kind of hurt.

626
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,870
You are my patient.

627
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,310
I would like to help.

628
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,480
You can't fix this one, buddy.

629
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,410
What are you doing?

630
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,740
I am downloading a database on personal loss.

631
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,450
Database downloaded.

632
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,050
Treatments include contact with friends and loved ones.

637
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,500
I am contacting them now.

638
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,170
No, no, no! I... Don't do that.

639
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,630
Your friends have been contacted.

640
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
Unbelievable.

641
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,430
Now, what are you doing?

642
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,390
Other treatments include compassion and physical reassurance.

643
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,900
I'm okay. Really.

644
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,140
You will be all right. There, there.

645
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,820
Thanks, Baymax.

646
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,450
I am sorry about the fire.

647
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,570
It's okay. It was an accident.

648
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,870
Unless...

649
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,210
Unless it wasn't.

650
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,700
At the showcase,

651
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,380
that guy in the mask stole my microbots. And...

652
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,090
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.

653
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,170
He's responsible for Tadashi.

654
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,600
We gotta catch that guy.

655
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,840
It's alive!

656
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,440
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!

657
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,810
If we're gonna catch that guy,

658
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,610
you need some upgrades.

659
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,770
Will apprehending the man

660
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,360
in the mask improve your emotional state?

661
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,190
Absolutely.

662
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,000
Let's work on your moves.

663
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,090
Now, let's take care of this.

664
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,040
I have some concerns.

665
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,060
This armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.

666
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,960
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

668
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,890
You look sick.

669
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,270
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

670
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,010
It's just an expression.

671
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,270
Data transfer complete.

673
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,330
I fail to see

674
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,920
how karate makes me a better healthcare companion.

675
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,590
You want to keep me healthy, don't you?

676
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,960
Punch this.

677
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,840
Yes! Hammerfist!

678
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,600
Side kick!

679
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,970
Knifehand!

680
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,610
Back kick!

681
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,690
Gummy bears!

682
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,120
Yes!

683
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,330
Yeah! Fist bump!

684
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,220
"Fist bump" Is not in my fighting database.

685
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,800
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

686
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,140
It's what people do sometimes

687
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,930
when they're excited or pumped up.

688
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,060
Hey, now you're getting it.

689
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,780
I will add "Fist bump" to my care-giving matrix.

690
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,280
All right. Let's go get that guy.

691
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,370
Come on!

692
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,350
Get him, Baymax!

693
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,780
We're too late.

694
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,520
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

695
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,450
Come on.

696
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,880
Always wait one hour after eating before swimming.

697
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,400
Come on!

698
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,320
Your heart rate has increased dramatic...

699
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,050
Okay, Baymax, time to use those upgrades.

700
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,440
-Hiro? -No, no, no!

701
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,890
Get out of here! Go!

702
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,640
Dude, what are you doing out here?

703
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,270
Nothing! Just out for a walk.

704
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,100
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

705
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,410
Is that Baymax?

706
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,150
Yeah, but you really...

707
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,940
Why is he wearing carbon fiber underpants?

708
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,750
I also know karate.

709
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,030
You guys need to go.

710
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,890
No, don't push us away, Hiro.

711
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,080
We're here for you.

712
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,750
That's why Baymax contacted us.

713
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,250
Those who suffer a loss,

714
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,670
require support from friends and loved ones.

715
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,870
Okay, but I...

716
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,800
Who would like to share their feelings first?

717
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,460
I'll go. Okay.

718
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,130
My name is Fred, and it has been 30 days since my last...

719
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,000
Holy mother of megazon!

720
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,930
Am I the only one seeing this?

721
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,220
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

722
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,060
Go!

723
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,610
Baymax, get him!

724
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,080
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

725
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,530
I'm saving your life.

726
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,900
Baymax can handle that guy!

727
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,490
Oh, no.

728
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,420
Wasabi!

729
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,130
Goodbye!

730
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,050
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

731
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,890
He stole my microbots. He started the fire.

732
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,510
I don't know who he is!

733
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,260
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

734
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,430
Hard left!

735
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,000
That mask, the black suit...

736
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,340
We're under attack from a super villain, people!

737
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,080
I mean, how cool is that?

738
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,370
I mean, it's scary, obviously. But how cool!

739
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,970
Why are we stopped?

740
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,010
The light's red!

741
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,640
There are no red lights in a car chase!

742
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,590
Why is he trying to kill us?

743
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,970
Why are you trying to kill us?

744
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,940
It's classic villain. We've seen too much!

745
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,320
Let's not jump to conclusions.

746
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,310
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

747
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,610
Car!

748
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,940
He's trying to kill us!

749
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,320
Did you just put your blinker on?

750
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,900
You have to indicate your turn!

751
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,190
It's the law!

752
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,250
That's it.

753
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,990
Stop the car!

754
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,320
Baymax and I can take this guy!

755
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,660
Seatbelts save lives.

756
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,290
Buckle up, every time.

757
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,000
What are you doing? What are you doing?

758
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,140
What are you doing? What are you doing?

759
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,850
-Did we lose him? -Look out!

760
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,440
Baymax, hold on!

761
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,040
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

762
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,400
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

763
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,240
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

764
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,250
We made it! Yes!

765
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,780
I told you we'd make it!

766
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
Your injuries require my attention.

767
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,250
And your body temperatures are low.

768
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,960
We should get out of here.

769
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,010
I know a place.

770
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,040
Where are we?

771
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,880
Fred.

772
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,350
Where are you going?

773
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,510
Welcome to mi casa.

775
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,360
That's French for "Front door."

776
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,180
It's really not.

777
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,530
Listen, nitwit.

778
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,190
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

779
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,810
I'm not in the mood for any...

780
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,480
Welcome home, master Frederick.

781
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,370
Heathcliff, my man!

782
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,820
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.

783
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,120
Gimme some.

784
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,960
Freddie,

785
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,970
this is your house?

786
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,920
I thought you lived under a bridge.

787
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,960
Well, technically, it belongs to my parents.

788
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,260
They're on a vacay on the family island.

789
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,840
You know, we should totally go some time. Frolic.

790
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,640
You gotta be kidding me.

792
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,490
If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask,

793
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,160
I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today.

794
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,410
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

795
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,990
Your body temperature is still low.

796
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,030
Yeah.

797
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,580
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

798
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,420
It's so nice.

799
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,300
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

800
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,090
Good robot.

801
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,900
Does this symbol mean anything to you guys?

802
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,060
-Yes! It's a bird! -No!

803
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,290
The guy in the mask was carrying something

804
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,520
with this symbol on it.

805
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,790
Apprehending the man in

806
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,860
the mask will improve Hiro's emotional state.

807
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,620
Apprehend him?

808
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,110
We don't even know who he is.

809
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,870
I have a theory.

810
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,920
"Dr. Slaughter, md"?

811
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,160
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

812
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,620
Malcolm chazzletick.

813
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,210
"The annihilator"?

814
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,920
Behind the mask, industrialist Reid Axworthy.

815
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,130
"Baron Von destruct"? Just get to the point!

816
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,460
Don't you guys get it?

817
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,930
The man in the mask who attacked us

818
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,480
is none other than...

819
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,220
Voila!

820
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,480
Alistair krei.

821
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,180
-What? -Think about it.

822
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,810
Krei wanted your microbots, and you said no.

823
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,430
But rules don't apply to a man like krei.

824
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,480
There's no way. The guy is too high profile.

825
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,530
Then who was that guy in the mask?

826
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,330
I don't know.

827
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,540
We don't know anything about him.

828
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,990
His blood type is ab-negative.

829
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,720
-Cholesterol levels are... - Baymax,

830
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,080
you scanned him?

831
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,920
I am programed to assess everyone's healthcare needs.

832
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,500
Yes!

833
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,040
I can use the data from your scan to find him.

834
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,830
You'd have to scan everyone in San fransokyo.

835
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,010
That might take, I don't know, forever.

836
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,530
No, no, no, no. I...

837
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,880
I just have to look for another angle.

838
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,510
Got it!

839
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,530
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

840
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,230
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

841
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,710
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

842
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,670
I need to upgrade all of you.

843
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,030
Upgrade who, now?

844
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,800
Those who suffer a loss

845
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,700
require support from friends and loved ones.

846
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,240
Okay, I like where this is heading!

847
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,910
We can't go against that guy! We're nerds!

848
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,270
Hiro, we want to help,

849
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,630
but we're just us.

850
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
No.

851
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,230
You can be way more.

852
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,840
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

853
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,960
We're in.

854
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,740
Can you feel it? You guys, do you feel this?

855
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,650
Our origin story begins.

856
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,740
We're gonna be superheroes!

857
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,060
Arms up.

858
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,430
The neurotransmitter must be in his mask.

859
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,820
We get the mask, and he can't control the bots.

860
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,980
Game over.

861
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,050
They say "We are what we are"

862
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,950
But we don't have to be

863
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,680
I'm bad behavior

864
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,710
But I do it in the best way

865
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,930
I'll be the watcher

866
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,100
Of the eternal flame

867
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,500
I'll be the guard dog

868
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,560
Of all your fever dreams

869
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,990
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass

870
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,540
Cause we could be immortals

871
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,300
Immortals

872
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,620
Just not for long for long

873
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,210
Live with me forever now

874
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,700
Pull the blackout curtains down

875
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,470
Just not for long for long

876
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,720
We could be immortals

877
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,520
Immortals

878
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,720
Immortals

879
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:46,320
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith

880
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,860
Is when it's tested again and again every day

881
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,330
I'm still comparing your past to my future

882
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,210
Cause we could be immortals

883
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,780
Immortals

884
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,250
Just not for long for long

885
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,250
Super jump!

886
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,550
Super jump!

887
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,050
Pull the blackout curtains down

888
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:13,970
-I breathe fire. -Just not for long for long

889
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,270
We could be immortals

890
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,780
Immortals

891
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:28,150
Immortals

892
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:32,910
Immortals

893
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,740
Immortals

894
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,220
I love it!

895
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,440
Not bad.

896
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,440
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

897
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,560
Hey, guys!

898
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,640
Check this out.

899
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,320
I'd like to introduce,

900
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,050
Baymax 2.0.

901
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,950
He's glorious.

902
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,590
Hold up. Focus.

903
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,010
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

904
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,430
The fist, show them the fist.

905
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,600
No, not that.

906
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,520
The thing, the other thing.

907
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,870
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

908
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,400
That's just one of his new upgrades!

909
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,330
Baymax, wings.

910
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,170
No way!

911
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,800
Thrusters.

912
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,440
I fail to see how flying

913
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,690
makes me a better healthcare companion.

914
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,770
I fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome!

915
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,310
Full thrust.

916
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,740
Steady, big guy.

917
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,660
Look, let's just take this slow.

918
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,830
Up, up, up, up, up!

919
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,240
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

920
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,040
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

921
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,660
Too much thrust!

922
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
No, no, no, no!

923
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,620
Back on! Back on!

924
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,310
On! On! On!

925
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,320
Go up! Up, up, up!

926
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,970
Oh, man!

927
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,330
Maybe... Maybe enough flying for today.

928
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
What do you say?

929
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,160
Your neurotransmitter levels are rising steadily.

930
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,650
Which means what?

931
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,290
The treatment is working.

932
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,820
Oh, no!

933
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,410
No, no, no, no, no!

934
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,760
Whoa, Baymax!

935
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,090
Yes!

936
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,290
That was...

937
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,410
That was...

938
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,080
Sick.

939
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,290
It is just an expression.

940
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,540
That's... that's right, buddy.

941
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:21,380
I am never taking the bus again.

942
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,430
Your emotional state has improved.

943
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,470
I can deactivate if you say you are satisfied with your care.

944
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,400
What?

945
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,240
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

946
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,910
We still have to find that guy.

947
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,030
So, fire up that super-sensor.

948
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,210
Functionality improved.

949
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,280
1000% increase in range.

950
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,840
I have found a match,

951
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,970
on that island.

952
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,590
-Killer view. -Yeah. If I...

953
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,760
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

954
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,050
I'd probably love this.

955
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,520
But I'm terrified of heights, so I don't love it.

956
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,240
There. Baymax, take us in.

957
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,820
Awesome!

958
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,280
Our first landing together as a team.

959
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,240
Guys, come on.

960
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,500
"Quarantine"?

961
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,410
Do you people know what "Quarantine" Means?

962
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,480
"Quarantine."

963
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,940
Enforced isolation to prevent contamination

964
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,980
that could lead to disease, or, in some cases, death.

965
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,210
There's a skull face on this one.

966
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,420
A skull face!

967
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,800
Be ready.

968
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,840
He could be anywhere.

969
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,060
Fire!

970
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,360
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

971
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,410
That was a bird.

972
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,950
Well, at least we know our gear works.

973
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,100
Six intrepid friends

974
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,520
Led by Fred

975
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,350
Their leader, Fred

976
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,850
Fred's angels

977
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,430
Fred's angels

978
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,370
Harnessing the power of the sun with the

979
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,190
Ancient amulet they found in the attic

980
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,730
The amulet is green

981
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,210
It's probably an emerald

982
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,660
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.

983
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,290
Guys, Shhhh...

984
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,200
Any sign of him, Baymax?

985
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,420
This structure is interfering with my sensor.

986
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,170
Perfect. The robot's broken.

987
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,640
Guys, you might want to see this.

988
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,010
What do you think it is, genius?

989
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,860
I'm not sure. But look.

990
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,610
Hiro.

991
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,260
Krei.

992
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:57,860
That's right.

993
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,400
We were asked to do the impossible.

994
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
That's what we did.

995
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:06,450
We've reinvented the very concept of transportation.

996
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:11,150
Friends, I present project Silent Sparrow.

997
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,930
General, may I?

998
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,720
Magic hat!

999
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,740
Teleportation.

1000
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,120
The transport of matter instantaneously through space.

1001
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,260
Not science fiction anymore.

1002
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:45,960
Now, we didn't spend billions of tax dollars to teleport hats.

1003
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,860
Ladies and gentlemen, you're here to witness history.

1004
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,300
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?

1005
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,620
We've invited all these people.

1006
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,360
Might as well give 'em a show.

1007
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,850
T-minus 30 seconds to launch.

1008
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,580
-29, 28... -This is argo.

1009
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,420
-Capsule's in position. -27...

1010
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,980
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity

1011
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,810
in the magnetic containment field.

1012
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,210
Mr. Krei, is there a problem?

1013
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,810
No. No problem.

1014
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,420
It's well within the parameters.

1015
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,930
Let's move forward.

1016
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,930
3, 2, 1.

1017
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,610
Cabin pressure is go.

1018
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,640
Pod engaged.

1019
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,780
Field breach! Abort!

1020
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,160
We've lost all contact with the pod.

1021
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,540
Oh, no.

1022
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,550
-It's breaking up! -The pilot is gone.

1023
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,200
Portal two is down.

1024
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,370
The magnetic containment field's down!

1025
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,630
Krei, shut it down now!

1026
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,550
I want this island sealed off!

1027
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,390
The government shut down Krei's experiment.

1028
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,340
And he's using your microbots to steal his machine back.

1029
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,480
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1030
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,350
Oh, no.

1031
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,620
Baymax, get us out of here.

1032
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,990
Go for the transmitter.

1033
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,660
Behind his mask.

1034
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,550
Baymax!

1035
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,660
All right, what's the plan?

1036
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,220
It's Fred time.

1037
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,290
Super jump!

1038
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,970
Gravity crush!

1039
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,500
Falling hard.

1040
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,350
Seriously, what is the plan?

1041
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,890
-Get the mask. -Right behind you.

1042
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,100
For real, what is the plan?

1043
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,010
Hey!

1044
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,900
You want to dance, masked man?

1045
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,780
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.

1046
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,900
Hand over the mask, or you'll get a taste of this!

1047
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,160
And a little bit of that!

1048
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,580
Hey! I did all right.

1049
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,670
Is that all you got?

1050
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,250
You got that, too?

1051
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,420
It's back into the fire!

1052
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,240
It's over, Krei.

1053
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,380
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1054
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,790
The explosion...

1055
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,130
You died.

1056
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,800
No. I had your microbots.

1057
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,800
But, Tadashi.

1058
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,070
You just let him die.

1059
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,480
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1060
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,110
He went in there to save you!

1061
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,650
That was his mistake!

1062
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,790
Baymax, destroy.

1063
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,250
My programing prevents me from injuring a human being.

1064
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,700
Not anymore.

1065
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,630
Hiro, this is not what...

1066
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,510
Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!

1067
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,010
No! Stop, Baymax!

1068
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,900
No, stop! He's getting away!

1069
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,740
Baymax!

1070
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,100
My healthcare protocol has been violated.

1071
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,870
I regret any distress I may have caused.

1072
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,360
How could you do that? I had him!

1073
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,360
What you just did, we never signed up for.

1074
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,710
We said we'd catch the guy.

1075
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:31,950
That's it.

1076
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,080
I never should have let you help me!

1077
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,040
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1078
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,220
My enhanced scanner has been damaged.

1079
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,670
Wings.

1080
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,050
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1081
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,550
Fly!

1082
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,340
Hiro!

1083
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,740
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1084
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,170
You appear to be distressed.

1085
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,870
I'm fine!

1086
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,870
There. Is it working?

1087
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,800
- My sensor is operational. - Good.

1088
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,590
Then let's get...

1089
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,290
What?

1090
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,600
Are you going to remove my healthcare chip?

1091
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,420
Yes. Open!

1092
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,510
My purpose is to heal the sick and injured.

1093
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,680
Baymax, open your access port.

1094
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,470
Do you want me to terminate Professor Callaghan?

1095
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,610
Just open!

1096
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,670
Will terminating Professor Callaghan

1097
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,520
improve your emotional state?

1098
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,910
Yes! No! I don't know!

1099
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,150
Open your access!

1100
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,660
- Is this what Tadashi wanted? - It doesn't matter!

1101
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,080
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1102
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,460
Tadashi's gone!

1103
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,380
Tadashi's gone.

1104
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,510
Tadashi is here.

1105
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,050
No. He's not here.

1106
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,090
Tadashi is here.

1107
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,090
This is Tadashi Hamada.

1108
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,940
And this is the first test of my robotics project.

1109
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,440
Hello, I am Baymax.

1110
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,240
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1111
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,370
The seventh test of my robotics project.

1112
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,790
Hello, I...

1113
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,120
What? What?

1114
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,410
Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop scan! Stop...

1115
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,990
Tadashi Hamada again,

1116
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:43,420
and this is the 33rd test of my robotics project.

1117
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,100
I'm not giving up on you.

1118
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,880
You don't understand this yet, but people need you.

1119
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,730
So, let's get back to work.

1120
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,010
This is Tadashi Hamada,

1121
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,650
and this is the 84th test.

1122
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,450
What do you say, big guy?

1123
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,070
Hello, I am Baymax,

1124
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,160
your personal healthcare companion.

1125
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,440
It works.

1126
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,830
It works!

1127
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:17,500
This is amazing! You... you work!

1128
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,090
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.

1129
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,370
I knew it. Oh, you work. I can't believe it! I can't...

1130
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,010
Okay. All right, big moment, here.

1131
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,390
Scan me.

1132
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:32,310
Your neurotransmitter levels are elevated.

1133
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,590
This indicates that you are happy.

1134
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:37,140
I am. I really am.

1135
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,180
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.

1136
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,100
You're gonna help so many people, buddy.

1137
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,850
So many.

1138
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,730
That's all for now. I am satisfied with my care.

1139
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,790
Thank you, Baymax.

1140
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,840
I'm so sorry.

1141
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,540
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1142
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,550
Hiro.

1143
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,060
Guys, I, I...

1144
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,980
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1145
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,360
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1146
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,290
But maybe don't leave your team

1147
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,240
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1148
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,240
- Oh, man. - Nah, it's cool.

1149
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,460
Heathcliff picked us up in the family chopper.

1150
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,410
Hiro, we found something you should see.

1151
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,750
You almost got us all killed!

1152
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,090
Krei! You did this!

1153
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,040
You knew it wasn't ready!

1154
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,970
Callaghan? He was there?

1155
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,270
He was such a good man. What happened?

1156
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,730
I don't know.

1157
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,690
But the answer's here somewhere.

1158
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,350
Wait, wait! Stop.

1159
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,140
There he is.

1160
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
With the pilot.

1161
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:11,400
Hang on.

1162
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,480
We've invited all these people...

1164
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,740
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1165
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,950
Callaghan blames Krei.

1166
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,570
This is a revenge story.

1167
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,670
So, what are we waiting for?

1168
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,670
It's all set up.

1169
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:38,340
This beautiful new campus is the culmination of a lifelong dream.

1170
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:41,130
But none of this would've been possible

1171
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,600
without a few bumps in the road.

1172
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:47,670
Those setbacks made us stronger,

1174
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,530
and set us on the path to a bright future.

1175
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,110
What is that?

1176
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,600
- What? - Setback?

1177
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,490
Was my daughter a "Setback"?

1178
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,920
Callaghan! But you...

1179
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,010
Your daughter, that...

1180
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,500
That was an accident.

1181
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,540
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1182
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,270
My daughter is gone because of your arrogance.

1183
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,140
What are you doing?

1184
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,140
You took everything from me

1185
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,450
when you sent Abigail into that machine.

1186
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,250
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1187
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,580
No!

1188
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,330
No! No! You can't!

1189
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,060
You're going to watch everything you've built disappear.

1190
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,810
Then, it's your turn.

1191
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,670
Professor Callaghan!

1192
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,320
Let him go!

1193
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,280
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1194
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,190
Abigail is gone!

1195
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,530
This won't change anything. Trust me, I know.

1196
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,400
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1197
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,620
Please, let me go.

1198
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,790
I'll give you anything you want!

1199
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,420
I want my daughter back!

1200
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,290
Go for the mask!

1201
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,570
Baymax!

1202
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,230
Leaping into action!

1203
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,680
Oh, no!

1204
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,510
Getting a little... A little tight.

1205
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,780
- No! - He's too strong!

1206
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,130
- There's no way out! - You can't beat him!

1207
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,620
Help! I can't beat him.

1208
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,050
Hiro!

1209
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,470
- Hiro? Hiro? - Help!

1210
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,180
- That's it! - Hiro.

1211
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,590
- I know how to beat him. - Hiro.

1212
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,640
Listen up!

1213
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,050
Use those big brains of yours,

1214
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,600
and think your way around the problem.

1215
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,170
Look for a new angle.

1216
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,230
My arms! They can't go any further!

1217
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,750
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1218
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,620
Hello, sign.

1219
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,120
Care to go for a little spin?

1220
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,750
Double spin!

1221
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:36,910
Behind-the-back spin!

1222
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,770
Baymax!

1223
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,780
Hiro.

1224
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,130
I love that robot!

1225
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,130
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.

1226
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,560
Take out the bots. They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1227
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,230
Now that is a plan!

1228
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,430
Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover?

1229
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,400
Like you have to ask.

1230
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,640
Let's do this, Freddie!

1231
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,610
Smokescreen!

1232
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,150
Ready and

1233
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,250
dive!

1234
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,210
Whoa, the gravity's getting a little weird here, guys!

1235
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,760
Wait. Let's use this!

1236
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,850
These are green blades of fury!

1237
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,800
Woman up!

1238
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,890
Double sign-spin.

1239
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,280
Now my signs are on fire!

1240
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,630
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1241
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:45,220
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1242
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,750
Hammerfist.

1243
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,380
This ends now!

1244
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,070
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1245
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,310
What?

1246
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,410
Baymax!

1247
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,240
No!

1248
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,210
Our programing prevents us from injuring a human being.

1249
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,800
But we'll take that.

1250
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,540
It's still on! We have to shut it down!

1251
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,000
We can't! The containment field is failing.

1252
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,420
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1253
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,290
We need to get out of here, now!

1254
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,970
Baymax!

1255
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,350
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1256
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,380
- What? - Coming from there.

1257
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,310
The life signs are female.

1258
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,730
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1259
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,070
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.

1260
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,610
Abigail.

1261
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,440
Let's go get her.

1262
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,320
The portal is destabilizing. You'll never make it.

1263
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:36,490
She's alive in there.

1264
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,370
Someone has to help.

1265
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,280
What do you say, buddy?

1266
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,160
Flying makes me a better healthcare companion.

1267
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,940
Careful! There's Krei tech debris everywhere.

1268
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,120
Look out!

1269
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,430
I have located the patient.

1270
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,680
Hurry!

1271
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,920
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1272
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,540
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1273
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,090
Veer right!

1274
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,020
Okay, to the left.

1275
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,230
Hard right!

1276
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,680
Up and over.

1277
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,270
Okay, level off. Easy.

1278
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,440
Nice flying!

1279
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,360
Almost there!

1280
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,630
Baymax!

1281
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:00,220
Baymax!

1282
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,300
My thrusters are inoperable.

1283
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,430
Just grab hold.

1284
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:24,400
There is still a way I can get you both to safety.

1285
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,330
I cannot deactivate until you say

1286
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,450
you are satisfied with your care.

1287
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,950
No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you?

1288
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,830
- You are my patient. - Baymax.

1289
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,420
Your health is my only concern.

1290
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,170
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1291
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,920
Are you satisfied with your care?

1292
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,850
No. There's gotta be another way.

1293
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,970
I'm not gonna leave you here. I'll think of something.

1294
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,520
There is no time.

1295
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,430
Are you satisfied with your care?

1296
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,140
Please! No.

1297
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,320
I can't lose you, too.

1298
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,780
Hiro, I will always be with you.

1299
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,890
I'm satisfied with my care.

1300
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,930
Hiro!

1301
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,100
Yeah! They made it!

1302
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,060
Baymax?

1303
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:31,750
Miss, can you hear me?

1304
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,460
What is your name?

1305
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,570
Abigail Callaghan.

1306
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,380
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.

1307
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,800
We're taking you to the hospital.

1308
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,040
Move it!

1309
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,550
Get in there.

1310
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,150
A massive cleanup continues today

1311
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,320
at the headquarters of Krei Tech Industries.

1313
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:06,730
Reports are still flooding in

1314
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,830
about a group of unidentified individuals,

1315
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,110
who prevented what could have been a major catastrophe.

1316
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,820
The whole city of San Fransokyo is asking,

1317
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,320
"Who are these heroes? And where are they now?"

1318
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,080
It's so exciting.

1319
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:22,510
Hey, sweetie!

1320
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,760
Okay.

1321
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,340
Last hug.

1322
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:31,680
Bye!

1323
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,340
- And just then I was like... - Get out of here.

1324
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,720
I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.

1325
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,530
Hello, Hiro.

1326
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,700
We didn't set out to be superheroes,

1327
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:43,080
but sometimes life doesn't go the way you planned.

1328
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,260
The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people,

1329
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,000
and that's what we're gonna do.

1330
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,720
Who are we?

1334
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:26,440
Dad, I just wish I could share my accomplishments with you.

1335
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:28,450
You mean so much to me, and honestly,

1336
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,940
I've always felt a distance

1337
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:33,360
what with you being on the family island all the time,

1338
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,730
and I just wish you could see how...

1339
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,130
Fred.

1340
01:40:58,970 --> 01:40:59,970
Son.

1341
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:01,940
Dad?

1342
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:08,310
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.

1343
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:13,620
I go inside out, then I go front and back.

1344
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:14,990
Dad!

1345
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,290
We have a lot to talk about.

2
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,980
Get up! Get up!

3
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,460
The winner,

4
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,720
by total annihilation,

5
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,680
Yama!

6
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,020
Who is next?

7
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Who has the guts to step into the ring with little Yama?

8
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,180
Yama!

9
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,730
Can I try?

10
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,150
I have a robot. I built it myself.

11
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,120
Beat it, kid.

12
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,040
House rules. You gotta pay to play.

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,500
Is this enough?

14
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,540
What's your name, little boy?

15
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,340
Hiro. Hiro Hamada.

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,090
Prepare your bot, zero.

17
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,560
Two bots enter,

18
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,860
one bot leaves.

19
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,990
Fighters ready?

20
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,270
Fight!

21
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,340
That was my first fight. I... Can I try again?

22
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,370
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

23
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,250
Go home.

24
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,870
I've got more money.

25
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,340
Fighters ready?

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,980
Fight!

27
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,260
Mega-bot, destroy.

28
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,820
What?

29
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,630
- No more little Yama. - But, wha...

30
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,420
This is not possible!

31
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,230
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

32
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,800
Beginner's luck.

33
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,310
Do you want to go again, Yama?

34
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,280
No one hustles Yama!

35
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,860
Teach him a lesson.

36
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,980
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.

37
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,950
- Hiro! Get on! - Tadashi!

38
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,620
Good timing!

39
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,830
Oh, mama!

40
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,540
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,890
- Are you hurt? - No.

42
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,010
Then what were you thinking, knucklehead?

43
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,770
You graduated high school when you were 13,

44
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,890
and this is what you're doing?

45
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
There they are!

46
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,530
Hold on!

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,770
Yes!

48
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,310
Get back here.

49
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,440
Bot fighting is illegal.

50
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,240
You're going to get yourself arrested.

51
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Bot fighting is not illegal.

52
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,910
Betting on bot fighting, that's... that's illegal.

53
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,170
But so lucrative!

54
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,630
I'm on a roll, big brother! And there is no stopping me!

55
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Oh, no.

57
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,980
Hi, Aunt Cass.

58
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,050
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.

59
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,610
- We're fine. - We're okay.

60
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,930
Oh, good.

61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,030
Then what were you two knuckleheads thinking?

62
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
For 10 years,

63
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,660
I have done the best I could to raise you.

64
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,520
Have I been perfect? No.

65
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,580
Do I know anything about children? No.

66
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,490
Should I have picked up a book on parenting?

67
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,830
Probably!

68
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,120
Where was I going with this? I had a point.

69
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,380
- Sorry. - We love you, Aunt Cass.

70
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,910
Well, I love you, too!

71
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,010
I had to close up early because of you two felons.

72
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,290
On beat poetry night.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,090
Stress eating. Because of you.

74
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,340
Come on, Mochi.

75
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,470
This is really good!

76
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,820
You better make this up to Aunt Cass

77
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,340
before she eats everything in the cafe.

78
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,640
For sure.

79
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,940
And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.

80
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,970
Absolutely.

81
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,860
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

82
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,320
There's a fight across town. If I book, I can still make it.

83
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,730
When are you gonna

84
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,780
start doing something with that big brain of yours?

85
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,700
What? Go to college like you?

86
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,580
So people can tell me stuff I already know?

87
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,420
Unbelievable.

88
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,030
What would mom and dad say?

89
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,300
I don't know.

90
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,010
They're gone.

91
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,380
They died when I was three, remember?

92
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,130
- I'll take you. - Really?

93
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,420
I can't stop you from going,

94
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,880
but I'm not going to let you go on your own.

95
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,190
Sweet.

97
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,860
What are we doing at your nerd school?

98
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,560
Bot-fight's that way!

100
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,110
Gotta grab something.

101
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,810
Is this gonna take long?

102
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,280
Relax, you big baby. We'll be in and out.

103
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,910
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,750
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

105
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,990
Heads up!

106
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,640
Electro-mag suspension?

107
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,270
- Who are you? - I'm...

108
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,350
Go go, this is my brother Hiro.

109
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,990
Welcome to the nerd lab.

110
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Yeah.

111
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,660
I've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.

112
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,330
Zero resistance, faster bike.

113
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,160
But, not fast enough,

114
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,710
yet.

115
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,170
Do not move. Behind the line, please.

116
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,970
Hey, Wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.

117
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,560
Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.

118
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,630
Catch.

119
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,610
- Laser-induced plasma? - Oh, yeah.

120
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,610
With a little magnetic confinement for ultra-precision.

121
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,820
Wow. How do you find anything in this mess?

122
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,820
I have a system.

123
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,950
There's a place for everything,

124
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,900
and everything in its place.

125
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,410
- Need this! - You can't do that!

126
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,610
This is anarchy! Society has rules!

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,460
Excuse me!

128
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,070
Coming through!

129
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,740
Tadashi!

130
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,870
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

131
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I've heard so much about you!

132
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,290
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

133
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,890
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

134
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,630
400 pounds of it!

135
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,960
Come here, come here, come here.

136
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,760
You're going to love this.

137
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,050
A dash of perchloric acid, a smidge of cobalt,

138
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,730
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

139
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,350
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...

140
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,810
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

141
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,360
It's so pink.

142
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,280
Here's the best part.

143
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,040
I know, right?

144
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,410
Chemical metal embrittlement.

145
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,050
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

146
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,830
"Honey Lemon"? "Go go"? "Wasabi"?

147
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,050
I spill wasabi on my shirt one time, people.

148
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,510
One time!

149
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,810
Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.

150
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,350
Who's Fred?

151
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,930
This guy, right here!

152
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,650
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,190
This is not my real face and body.

154
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,470
The name's Fred.

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,520
School mascot by day, but by night,

156
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,650
I am also a school mascot.

157
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,200
So, what's your major?

158
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,740
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

159
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,910
But I am a major science enthusiast.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,120
I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula,

161
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,250
that can turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will.

162
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,660
But she says that's "Not science."

163
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,910
It's really not.

164
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,630
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

165
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,590
I asked Wasabi for isn't "Science" either.

166
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,790
- Is it? - Nope.

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,630
Well, then, what about "Invisible sandwich"?

168
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,840
- Hiro. - Imagine eating a sandwich,

169
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,920
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

170
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,050
Just stop.

171
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,340
- Laser eyes? - What?

172
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,220
- Tingly fingers? - Never gonna happen.

173
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,470
Hey, what about a growth serum?

174
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,610
So, what have you been working on?

175
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,930
I'll show you.

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,060
Duct tape?

177
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,020
I hate to break it to you, bro.

178
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,310
Already been invented.

179
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,870
Dude!

180
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Ow!

181
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,170
This is what I've been working on.

182
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
Hello. I am Baymax.

183
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,240
Your personal healthcare companion.

184
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,700
I was alerted to the need

185
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,160
for medical attention when you said, "Ow."

186
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,440
A robotic nurse.

187
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,490
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

188
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,490
Physical or emotional?

189
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,790
I will scan you now.

190
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,160
Scan complete.

191
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,880
You have a slight epidermal abrasion on your forearm.

192
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,590
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

193
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,260
What's in the spray, specifically?

194
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,350
The primary ingredient is Bacitracin.

195
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,020
That's a bummer. I'm actually allergic to that.

196
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,110
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

197
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,650
You do have a mild allergy to peanuts.

198
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,350
Not bad.

199
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,030
You've done some serious coding on this thing, huh?

200
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,150
Programed him with over 10,000 medical procedures.

202
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,830
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.

203
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,670
Vinyl?

204
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,960
Yeah, going for a non-threatening, huggable kind of thing.

205
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,170
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

206
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,800
- No offense. - I am a robot.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,210
I cannot be offended.

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,390
- Hyperspectral cameras? -Yep.

209
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,100
- Titanium skeleton? - Carbon fiber.

210
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,440
Right. Even lighter.

211
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,890
Killer actuators. Where did you get those?

212
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,640
Machined them right here, in-house.

213
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,030
- Really? - Yup.

214
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,690
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

215
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Shut up.

216
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,520
You have been a good boy. Have a lollipop.

217
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,870
Nice.

218
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,090
I cannot deactivate until you say

219
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,450
you are satisfied with your care.

220
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,450
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

221
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,580
He's going to help a lot of people.

222
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,700
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

223
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Lithium ion.

224
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,720
You know, supercapacitors would charge way faster.

225
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,960
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?

226
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,050
Hey, Professor.

227
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,090
Actually, I was just finishing up.

228
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,390
You must be Hiro.

229
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,050
Bot-fighter, right?

230
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,900
When my daughter was younger, that's all she wanted to do.

231
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,140
May I?

232
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,600
Sure.

233
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,070
Magnetic-bearing servos.

234
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,450
Pretty sick, huh?

235
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,770
Wanna see how I put 'em together?

236
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,330
Hey, genius!

237
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,280
He invented them.

238
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,740
You're Robert Callaghan?

239
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,570
Like, as in,

240
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,450
the Callaghan-catmull spline,

241
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,080
and Callaghan's "Laws of robotics"?

242
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,290
That's right.

243
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,120
Ever think about applying here?

244
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,670
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

245
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I don't know.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,250
He's pretty serious about his career in bot-fighting.

247
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,750
Well, kind of serious.

248
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,970
I can see why.

249
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,090
With your bot, winning must come easy.

250
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,010
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,200
Well, if you like things easy,

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,520
then my program isn't for you.

253
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,020
We push the boundaries of robotics here.

254
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,650
My students go on to shape the future.

255
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,450
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

256
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,030
Good luck with the bot-fights.

257
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,950
We gotta hurry if you want to catch that bot-fight.

258
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,750
I have to go here.

259
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,460
If I don't go to this nerd school,

260
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,830
I'm gonna lose my mind.

261
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
How do I get in?

263
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,220
Every year, the school has a student showcase.

264
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,200
You come up with something that blows Callaghan away,

265
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,930
you're in.

266
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,720
But, it's gotta be great.

268
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,140
Trust me.

269
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,300
It will be.

270
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,730
Nothing!

271
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,990
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!

272
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,330
Wow. Washed up at 14.

273
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,450
So sad.

274
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,330
I got nothing! I'm done. I'm never getting in.

275
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,340
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.

276
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,380
What are you doing?

277
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,840
Shake things up.

278
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,340
Use that big brain of yours to think your way out.

279
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,510
- What? - Look for a new angle.

280
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,210
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.

281
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,550
How are you feeling?

282
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,380
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.

283
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,230
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

284
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,440
Yep, he's nervous.

285
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,890
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

286
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,730
- He's so tense. - No, I'm not.

287
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,400
Relax, Hiro.

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,310
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go go.

289
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,040
Stop whining. Woman up.

290
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm fine!

291
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,560
What do you need, little man? Deodorant? Breath mint?

292
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Fresh pair of underpants?

293
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,790
Underpants? You need serious help.

294
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey, I come prepared.

295
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,110
I haven't done laundry in six months.

296
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,420
One pair lasts me four days.

297
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,570
I go front, I go back,

298
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,740
I go inside-out. Then I go front and back.

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,170
Wow. That is both disgusting and awesome.

300
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,510
Don't encourage him.

301
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,080
It's called "Recycling."

302
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,850
Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.

303
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,800
Oh, yeah. This is it.

304
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,970
I guess I'm up.

305
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,260
Okay, photo, photo! Everybody say, "Hiro."

306
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,840
- Hiro! - Yeah!

307
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,600
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

308
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,190
- Don't mess it up. - Break a leg, little man.

309
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,820
Science, yeah!

310
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,100
All right, bro. This is it.

311
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,700
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

312
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,780
What's going on?

313
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,330
I really want to go here.

314
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
You got this.

315
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,290
My name is Hiro...

316
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,930
Sorry.

317
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,770
My name is Hiro Hamada,

318
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,310
and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool.

319
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,310
I hope you like it.

320
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,150
This is a microbot.

321
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,460
Breathe.

322
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,660
It doesn't look like much,

323
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,040
but when it links up with the rest of its pals,

324
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,510
things get a little more interesting.

325
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,910
The microbots are controlled with this neural transmitter.

326
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,530
I think what I want them to do...

327
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,580
They do it.

328
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,870
The applications for this tech are limitless.

329
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,510
Construction.

330
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,340
What used to take teams of people working by hand

331
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,760
for months or years,

332
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,560
can now be accomplished by one person.

333
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,050
And that's just the beginning.

334
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,760
How about transportation?

335
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,390
Microbots can move anything anywhere,

336
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,200
with ease.

337
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,580
If you can think it, the microbots can do it.

338
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
The only limit is your imagination.

339
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,930
Microbots!

340
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,390
That's my nephew!

341
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,690
Yes!

342
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,480
My family! I love my family!

343
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,270
Nailed it!

344
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,270
- You did it! - Not bad!

345
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,280
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!

346
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,770
They loved you. That was amazing!

347
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,280
Yes.

348
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,580
With some development, your tech could be revolutionary.

349
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,820
Alistair Krei!

350
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,460
May I?

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,130
Extraordinary.

352
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,470
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

353
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,170
Shut up.

354
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,830
Mr. Krei is right.

355
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,840
Your microbots are an inspired piece of tech.

356
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,630
You can continue to develop them,

357
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,310
or you can sell them to a man

358
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,520
who's only guided by his own self-interest.

359
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,440
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

360
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,680
but it shouldn't affect...

361
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,470
This is your decision, Hiro.

362
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,690
But you should know

363
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,650
Mr. Krei has cut corners and ignored sound science

364
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
to get where he is.

365
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,150
That's just not true.

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,060
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech

367
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,870
with your microbots,

368
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,500
or anything else.

369
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,420
Hiro, I'm offering you

370
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,030
more money than any 14-year-old could imagine.

371
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,060
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,

372
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,460
but they're not for sale.

373
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,390
I thought you were smarter than that.

374
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,960
Robert.

375
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,060
Mr. Krei.

376
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,390
That's my brother's.

377
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,860
That's right.

378
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,200
I look forward to seeing you in class.

379
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,870
Unbelievable!

380
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,150
That's what I'm talking about.

381
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,960
All right, geniuses,

382
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,370
let's feed those hungry brains.

383
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Back to the cafe!

384
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,880
Dinner is on me!

385
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,880
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

386
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,870
- Aunt Cass? - Unless it's moldy.

387
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,370
We'll... we'll catch up, okay?

388
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,720
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

389
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,590
Both of you.

390
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,930
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

391
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,270
I know what you're going to say.

392
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,190
"I should be proud of myself,"

393
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,110
"because I'm finally using my gift for something important."

394
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,270
No, no. I was just gonna

395
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,030
tell you your fly was down for the whole show.

396
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,110
Ha-ha-hilarious.

397
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,080
What?

398
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,130
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

399
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,450
Hey, I...

400
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,430
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. So,

401
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,430
you know,

402
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,430
thanks for not giving up on me.

403
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,100
Are you okay?

404
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,780
Yeah. I'm okay.

405
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,570
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.

406
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,440
Tadashi, no!

407
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,420
Callaghan's in there.

408
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,790
Someone has to help.

409
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,810
Tadashi!

410
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,480
Tadashi!

411
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,040
Here. Have some tea.

412
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,240
Hey, sweetie.

413
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,690
Hey, Aunt Cass.

414
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,620
Mrs. Matsuda's in the cafe.

415
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,080
She's wearing something super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.

416
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,410
That always cracks you up.

417
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,580
You should come down.

418
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,960
Maybe later.

419
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,050
The university called again.

420
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,290
It's been a few weeks since classes started.

421
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,710
But they said it's not too late to register.

422
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,470
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.

424
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,950
Hey, Hiro.

425
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,820
We just wanted to check in, and see how you're doing.

426
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,090
We wish you were here, buddy.

427
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,120
Hiro, if I could have only one superpower right now,

428
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,670
it would be the ability to crawl through this camera,

429
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,130
and give you a big hug.

430
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Ow!

431
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,060
Hello. I am Baymax,

432
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,020
your personal healthcare companion.

433
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,020
Hey, Baymax.

434
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,860
I didn't know you were still active.

435
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,030
I heard a sound of distress.

436
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,650
What seems to be the trouble?

437
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,750
I just stubbed my toe a little.

438
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm fine.

439
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,200
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

440
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,210
A zero. I'm okay, really.

441
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,290
Thanks. You can shrink now.

442
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,970
Does it hurt when I touch it?

443
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,930
That's okay. No touching.

444
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,590
I'm fine...

445
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,050
You have fallen.

446
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,230
You think?

447
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,740
- On a scale of 1 to... - Ow!

448
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,100
On a scale...

449
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,270
On a sca...

450
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,620
On a scale of 1 to 10...

451
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,280
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

452
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,080
Zero.

453
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,450
- It is all right to cry. - No. No, no, no, no.

454
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,240
Crying is a natural response to pain.

455
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,410
I'm not crying.

456
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,910
- I will scan you for injuries. - Don't scan me.

457
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,750
- Scan complete. - Unbelievable.

458
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,760
You have sustained no injuries.

459
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,420
However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels

460
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,420
indicate that you are experiencing mood swings,

461
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,800
common in adolescence.

462
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,420
Diagnosis, puberty.

463
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,770
What?

464
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,350
Okay. Time to shrink now.

465
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,470
You should expect an increase in body hair,

466
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,110
especially on your face, chest, armpits, and...

467
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,490
Thank you! That's enough.

468
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,270
You may also experience strange and powerful new urges.

469
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,280
Okay! Let's get you back in your luggage.

470
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,510
I cannot deactivate until you say

471
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,450
you are satisfied with your care.

472
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,120
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

473
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,470
My microbot?

474
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,960
This doesn't make any sense.

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,430
Puberty can often be a confusing time

476
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,650
for a young adolescent flowering into manhood.

477
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,640
No. The thing is attracted to the other microbots,

478
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,640
but that's impossible.

479
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,810
They were destroyed in the fire.

480
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,990
Dumb thing's broken.

481
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,160
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

482
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,340
Oh, yeah?

483
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,010
Why don't you find out where it's trying to go?

484
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,660
Would that stabilize your pubescent mood swings?

485
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,220
Absolutely.

486
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,180
Baymax?

487
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,350
Baymax?

488
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,650
Baymax?

489
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,410
What?

490
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,540
- Hiro? - Hey, Aunt Cass!

491
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,910
Wow. You're up and...

492
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,870
Yeah! I figured it was time.

493
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,910
Are you registering for school?

494
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Yes.

495
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,950
I thought about what you said. Really inspired me.

496
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,380
Oh, honey, that's so great.

497
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,880
Okay,

498
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,300
special dinner tonight.

499
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,800
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

500
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,390
You know, with the hot sauce that makes our faces numb.

501
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,220
- Okay, sounds good. - Great!

502
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,890
Last hug.

503
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,070
Baymax!

504
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,240
Baymax!

505
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Watch it!

506
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,810
Baymax!

507
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,280
Baymax!

508
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,110
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

509
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,860
I have found where your tiny robot wants to go.

510
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,460
I told you, it's broken. It's not trying to go...

511
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,670
Locked.

512
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,890
There is a window.

513
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,840
Please exercise caution.

514
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,400
A fall from this height could lead to bodily harm.

515
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,380
Oh, no.

516
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,380
Excuse me while I let out some air.

517
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
Are you done?

518
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,350
Yes.

519
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,110
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

520
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,680
Fine, just keep it down.

521
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,570
My microbots?

522
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,120
Someone's making more.

523
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,340
Hiro?

524
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,750
You gave me a heart attack!

525
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,090
My hands are equipped with defibrillators. Clear.

526
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,920
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression.

527
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,300
Oh, no.

528
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,640
Run!

529
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,810
Oh, come on!

530
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,310
I am not fast.

531
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,940
Yeah, no kidding!

532
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,610
Go! Go! Come on.

533
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,030
Kick it down!

534
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,950
Then punch it!

535
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,130
Go! Go!

536
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,500
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

537
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Move it!

538
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,800
Come on!

539
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,320
No, no.

540
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,410
Come on! The window!

541
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,490
Suck it in!

542
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,340
Baymax!

543
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,000
Hiro?

544
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,100
Come on, let's get out of here.

545
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,020
Go! Hurry!

546
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,100
All right, let me get this straight.

547
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,200
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

548
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,520
with an army of miniature flying robots.

549
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,190
"Microbots."

550
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,370
-Microbots. -Yeah.

551
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,910
He was controlling them

552
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,280
telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter.

553
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,210
So, Mr. Kabuki was using esp

554
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,050
to attack you and balloon man.

555
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,820
Did you file a report when your flying robots were stolen?

556
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,090
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

557
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,620
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

558
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,330
but Baymax was there, too.

559
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,470
-Tell him. -Yes, officer.

560
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,420
He's telling the truth.

561
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,760
What the... What's wrong with you?

562
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,600
Low battery.

563
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,430
Try to keep it together.

564
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,610
I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion.

565
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,300
Kid, how about we call your parents,

566
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,610
and get them down here?

567
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,940
What?

568
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,690
Write your name and number down

569
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,290
on this piece of paper, and we can...

570
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,130
I've gotta get you home to your charging station.

571
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Can you walk?

572
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,120
I will scan you now. Scan complete.

573
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,680
Healthcare.

574
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Okay.

575
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,390
If my aunt asks, we were at school all day. Got it?

576
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,890
We jumped out a window.

577
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,780
No! Quiet!

578
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,660
We jumped out a window.

579
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,980
You can't say things like that around aunt Cass.

580
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,340
Hiro?

581
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,660
You home, sweetie?

582
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,680
That's right.

583
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,380
I thought I heard you.

584
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,670
Hey, aunt Cass.

585
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,010
Look at my little college man.

586
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,230
I can't wait to hear all about it!

587
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,510
And wings are almost ready.

588
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Whee!

589
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Will you be quiet?

590
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,680
Yeah, wings! Whee!

591
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,570
All right, get ready to have your face melted.

592
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,690
We are gonna feel these things tomorrow.

593
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,190
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Okay.

595
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,870
Sit down. Tell me everything.

596
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,630
The thing is that, since I registered so late,

597
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,120
I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.

598
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,580
What was that?

599
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,380
Mochi.

600
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,890
That darn cat.

601
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,560
At least take a plate for the road, okay?

602
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,890
-Don't work too... -Thanks for understanding.

603
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:39,060
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

604
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,360
All right, come on.

605
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm healthcare, your personal baymax companion.

606
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,690
One foot in front of the other.

607
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,680
This doesn't make any sense.

608
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,210
Tadashi.

609
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,340
What?

610
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,020
Tadashi.

611
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,980
Tadashi's gone.

612
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,400
When will he return?

613
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,820
He's dead, baymax.

614
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,660
Tadashi was in excellent health.

615
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,900
With a proper diet and exercise,

616
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,960
he should have lived a long life.

617
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,910
Yeah, he should have.

618
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,380
But there was a fire and...

619
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,540
Now, he's gone.

620
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,050
-Tadashi is here. -No.

621
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,680
People keep saying he's not really gone.

622
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,140
As long as we remember him.

623
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,640
It still hurts.

624
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,640
I see no evidence of physical injury.

625
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,570
It's a different kind of hurt.

626
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,870
You are my patient.

627
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,310
I would like to help.

628
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,480
You can't fix this one, buddy.

629
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,410
What are you doing?

630
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,740
I am downloading a database on personal loss.

631
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,450
Database downloaded.

632
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,050
Treatments include contact with friends and loved ones.

637
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,500
I am contacting them now.

638
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,170
No, no, no! I... Don't do that.

639
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,630
Your friends have been contacted.

640
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
Unbelievable.

641
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,430
Now, what are you doing?

642
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,390
Other treatments include compassion and physical reassurance.

643
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,900
I'm okay. Really.

644
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,140
You will be all right. There, there.

645
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,820
Thanks, Baymax.

646
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,450
I am sorry about the fire.

647
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,570
It's okay. It was an accident.

648
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,870
Unless...

649
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,210
Unless it wasn't.

650
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,700
At the showcase,

651
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,380
that guy in the mask stole my microbots. And...

652
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,090
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.

653
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,170
He's responsible for Tadashi.

654
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,600
We gotta catch that guy.

655
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,840
It's alive!

656
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,440
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!

657
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,810
If we're gonna catch that guy,

658
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,610
you need some upgrades.

659
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,770
Will apprehending the man

660
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,360
in the mask improve your emotional state?

661
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,190
Absolutely.

662
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,000
Let's work on your moves.

663
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,090
Now, let's take care of this.

664
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,040
I have some concerns.

665
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,060
This armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.

666
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,960
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

668
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,890
You look sick.

669
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,270
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

670
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,010
It's just an expression.

671
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,270
Data transfer complete.

673
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,330
I fail to see

674
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,920
how karate makes me a better healthcare companion.

675
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,590
You want to keep me healthy, don't you?

676
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,960
Punch this.

677
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,840
Yes! Hammerfist!

678
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,600
Side kick!

679
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,970
Knifehand!

680
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,610
Back kick!

681
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,690
Gummy bears!

682
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,120
Yes!

683
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,330
Yeah! Fist bump!

684
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,220
"Fist bump" Is not in my fighting database.

685
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,800
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

686
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,140
It's what people do sometimes

687
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,930
when they're excited or pumped up.

688
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,060
Hey, now you're getting it.

689
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,780
I will add "Fist bump" to my care-giving matrix.

690
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,280
All right. Let's go get that guy.

691
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,370
Come on!

692
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,350
Get him, Baymax!

693
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,780
We're too late.

694
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,520
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

695
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,450
Come on.

696
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,880
Always wait one hour after eating before swimming.

697
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,400
Come on!

698
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,320
Your heart rate has increased dramatic...

699
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,050
Okay, Baymax, time to use those upgrades.

700
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,440
-Hiro? -No, no, no!

701
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,890
Get out of here! Go!

702
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,640
Dude, what are you doing out here?

703
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,270
Nothing! Just out for a walk.

704
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,100
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

705
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,410
Is that Baymax?

706
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,150
Yeah, but you really...

707
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,940
Why is he wearing carbon fiber underpants?

708
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,750
I also know karate.

709
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,030
You guys need to go.

710
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,890
No, don't push us away, Hiro.

711
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,080
We're here for you.

712
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,750
That's why Baymax contacted us.

713
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,250
Those who suffer a loss,

714
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,670
require support from friends and loved ones.

715
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,870
Okay, but I...

716
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,800
Who would like to share their feelings first?

717
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,460
I'll go. Okay.

718
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,130
My name is Fred, and it has been 30 days since my last...

719
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,000
Holy mother of megazon!

720
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,930
Am I the only one seeing this?

721
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,220
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

722
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,060
Go!

723
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,610
Baymax, get him!

724
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,080
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

725
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,530
I'm saving your life.

726
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,900
Baymax can handle that guy!

727
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,490
Oh, no.

728
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,420
Wasabi!

729
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,130
Goodbye!

730
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,050
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

731
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,890
He stole my microbots. He started the fire.

732
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,510
I don't know who he is!

733
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,260
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

734
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,430
Hard left!

735
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,000
That mask, the black suit...

736
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,340
We're under attack from a super villain, people!

737
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,080
I mean, how cool is that?

738
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,370
I mean, it's scary, obviously. But how cool!

739
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,970
Why are we stopped?

740
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,010
The light's red!

741
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,640
There are no red lights in a car chase!

742
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,590
Why is he trying to kill us?

743
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,970
Why are you trying to kill us?

744
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,940
It's classic villain. We've seen too much!

745
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,320
Let's not jump to conclusions.

746
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,310
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

747
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,610
Car!

748
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,940
He's trying to kill us!

749
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,320
Did you just put your blinker on?

750
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,900
You have to indicate your turn!

751
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,190
It's the law!

752
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,250
That's it.

753
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,990
Stop the car!

754
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,320
Baymax and I can take this guy!

755
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,660
Seatbelts save lives.

756
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,290
Buckle up, every time.

757
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,000
What are you doing? What are you doing?

758
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,140
What are you doing? What are you doing?

759
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,850
-Did we lose him? -Look out!

760
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,440
Baymax, hold on!

761
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,040
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

762
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,400
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

763
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,240
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

764
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,250
We made it! Yes!

765
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,780
I told you we'd make it!

766
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
Your injuries require my attention.

767
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,250
And your body temperatures are low.

768
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,960
We should get out of here.

769
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,010
I know a place.

770
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,040
Where are we?

771
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,880
Fred.

772
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,350
Where are you going?

773
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,510
Welcome to mi casa.

775
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,360
That's French for "Front door."

776
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,180
It's really not.

777
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,530
Listen, nitwit.

778
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,190
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

779
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,810
I'm not in the mood for any...

780
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,480
Welcome home, master Frederick.

781
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,370
Heathcliff, my man!

782
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,820
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.

783
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,120
Gimme some.

784
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,960
Freddie,

785
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,970
this is your house?

786
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,920
I thought you lived under a bridge.

787
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,960
Well, technically, it belongs to my parents.

788
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,260
They're on a vacay on the family island.

789
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,840
You know, we should totally go some time. Frolic.

790
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,640
You gotta be kidding me.

792
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,490
If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask,

793
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,160
I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today.

794
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,410
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

795
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,990
Your body temperature is still low.

796
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,030
Yeah.

797
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,580
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

798
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,420
It's so nice.

799
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,300
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

800
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,090
Good robot.

801
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,900
Does this symbol mean anything to you guys?

802
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,060
-Yes! It's a bird! -No!

803
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,290
The guy in the mask was carrying something

804
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,520
with this symbol on it.

805
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,790
Apprehending the man in

806
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,860
the mask will improve Hiro's emotional state.

807
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,620
Apprehend him?

808
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,110
We don't even know who he is.

809
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,870
I have a theory.

810
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,920
"Dr. Slaughter, md"?

811
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,160
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

812
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,620
Malcolm chazzletick.

813
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,210
"The annihilator"?

814
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,920
Behind the mask, industrialist Reid Axworthy.

815
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,130
"Baron Von destruct"? Just get to the point!

816
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,460
Don't you guys get it?

817
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,930
The man in the mask who attacked us

818
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,480
is none other than...

819
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,220
Voila!

820
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,480
Alistair krei.

821
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,180
-What? -Think about it.

822
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,810
Krei wanted your microbots, and you said no.

823
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,430
But rules don't apply to a man like krei.

824
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,480
There's no way. The guy is too high profile.

825
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,530
Then who was that guy in the mask?

826
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,330
I don't know.

827
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,540
We don't know anything about him.

828
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,990
His blood type is ab-negative.

829
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,720
-Cholesterol levels are... - Baymax,

830
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,080
you scanned him?

831
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,920
I am programed to assess everyone's healthcare needs.

832
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,500
Yes!

833
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,040
I can use the data from your scan to find him.

834
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,830
You'd have to scan everyone in San fransokyo.

835
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,010
That might take, I don't know, forever.

836
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,530
No, no, no, no. I...

837
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,880
I just have to look for another angle.

838
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,510
Got it!

839
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,530
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

840
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,230
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

841
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,710
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

842
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,670
I need to upgrade all of you.

843
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,030
Upgrade who, now?

844
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,800
Those who suffer a loss

845
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,700
require support from friends and loved ones.

846
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,240
Okay, I like where this is heading!

847
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,910
We can't go against that guy! We're nerds!

848
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,270
Hiro, we want to help,

849
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,630
but we're just us.

850
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
No.

851
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,230
You can be way more.

852
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,840
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

853
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,960
We're in.

854
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,740
Can you feel it? You guys, do you feel this?

855
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,650
Our origin story begins.

856
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,740
We're gonna be superheroes!

857
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,060
Arms up.

858
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,430
The neurotransmitter must be in his mask.

859
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,820
We get the mask, and he can't control the bots.

860
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,980
Game over.

861
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,050
They say "We are what we are"

862
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,950
But we don't have to be

863
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,680
I'm bad behavior

864
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,710
But I do it in the best way

865
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,930
I'll be the watcher

866
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,100
Of the eternal flame

867
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,500
I'll be the guard dog

868
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,560
Of all your fever dreams

869
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,990
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass

870
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,540
Cause we could be immortals

871
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,300
Immortals

872
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,620
Just not for long for long

873
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,210
Live with me forever now

874
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,700
Pull the blackout curtains down

875
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,470
Just not for long for long

876
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,720
We could be immortals

877
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,520
Immortals

878
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,720
Immortals

879
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:46,320
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith

880
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,860
Is when it's tested again and again every day

881
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,330
I'm still comparing your past to my future

882
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,210
Cause we could be immortals

883
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,780
Immortals

884
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,250
Just not for long for long

885
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,250
Super jump!

886
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,550
Super jump!

887
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,050
Pull the blackout curtains down

888
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:13,970
-I breathe fire. -Just not for long for long

889
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,270
We could be immortals

890
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,780
Immortals

891
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:28,150
Immortals

892
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:32,910
Immortals

893
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,740
Immortals

894
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,220
I love it!

895
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,440
Not bad.

896
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,440
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

897
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,560
Hey, guys!

898
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,640
Check this out.

899
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,320
I'd like to introduce,

900
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,050
Baymax 2.0.

901
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,950
He's glorious.

902
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,590
Hold up. Focus.

903
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,010
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

904
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,430
The fist, show them the fist.

905
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,600
No, not that.

906
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,520
The thing, the other thing.

907
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,870
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

908
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,400
That's just one of his new upgrades!

909
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,330
Baymax, wings.

910
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,170
No way!

911
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,800
Thrusters.

912
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,440
I fail to see how flying

913
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,690
makes me a better healthcare companion.

914
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,770
I fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome!

915
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,310
Full thrust.

916
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,740
Steady, big guy.

917
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,660
Look, let's just take this slow.

918
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,830
Up, up, up, up, up!

919
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,240
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

920
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,040
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

921
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,660
Too much thrust!

922
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
No, no, no, no!

923
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,620
Back on! Back on!

924
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,310
On! On! On!

925
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,320
Go up! Up, up, up!

926
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,970
Oh, man!

927
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,330
Maybe... Maybe enough flying for today.

928
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
What do you say?

929
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,160
Your neurotransmitter levels are rising steadily.

930
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,650
Which means what?

931
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,290
The treatment is working.

932
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,820
Oh, no!

933
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,410
No, no, no, no, no!

934
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,760
Whoa, Baymax!

935
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,090
Yes!

936
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,290
That was...

937
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,410
That was...

938
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,080
Sick.

939
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,290
It is just an expression.

940
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,540
That's... that's right, buddy.

941
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:21,380
I am never taking the bus again.

942
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,430
Your emotional state has improved.

943
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,470
I can deactivate if you say you are satisfied with your care.

944
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,400
What?

945
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,240
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

946
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,910
We still have to find that guy.

947
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,030
So, fire up that super-sensor.

948
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,210
Functionality improved.

949
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,280
1000% increase in range.

950
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,840
I have found a match,

951
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,970
on that island.

952
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,590
-Killer view. -Yeah. If I...

953
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,760
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

954
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,050
I'd probably love this.

955
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,520
But I'm terrified of heights, so I don't love it.

956
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,240
There. Baymax, take us in.

957
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,820
Awesome!

958
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,280
Our first landing together as a team.

959
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,240
Guys, come on.

960
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,500
"Quarantine"?

961
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,410
Do you people know what "Quarantine" Means?

962
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,480
"Quarantine."

963
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,940
Enforced isolation to prevent contamination

964
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,980
that could lead to disease, or, in some cases, death.

965
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,210
There's a skull face on this one.

966
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,420
A skull face!

967
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,800
Be ready.

968
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,840
He could be anywhere.

969
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,060
Fire!

970
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,360
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

971
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,410
That was a bird.

972
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,950
Well, at least we know our gear works.

973
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,100
Six intrepid friends

974
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,520
Led by Fred

975
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,350
Their leader, Fred

976
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,850
Fred's angels

977
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,430
Fred's angels

978
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,370
Harnessing the power of the sun with the

979
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,190
Ancient amulet they found in the attic

980
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,730
The amulet is green

981
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,210
It's probably an emerald

982
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,660
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.

983
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,290
Guys, Shhhh...

984
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,200
Any sign of him, Baymax?

985
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,420
This structure is interfering with my sensor.

986
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,170
Perfect. The robot's broken.

987
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,640
Guys, you might want to see this.

988
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,010
What do you think it is, genius?

989
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,860
I'm not sure. But look.

990
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,610
Hiro.

991
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,260
Krei.

992
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:57,860
That's right.

993
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,400
We were asked to do the impossible.

994
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
That's what we did.

995
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:06,450
We've reinvented the very concept of transportation.

996
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:11,150
Friends, I present project Silent Sparrow.

997
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,930
General, may I?

998
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,720
Magic hat!

999
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,740
Teleportation.

1000
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,120
The transport of matter instantaneously through space.

1001
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,260
Not science fiction anymore.

1002
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:45,960
Now, we didn't spend billions of tax dollars to teleport hats.

1003
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,860
Ladies and gentlemen, you're here to witness history.

1004
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,300
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?

1005
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,620
We've invited all these people.

1006
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,360
Might as well give 'em a show.

1007
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,850
T-minus 30 seconds to launch.

1008
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,580
-29, 28... -This is argo.

1009
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,420
-Capsule's in position. -27...

1010
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,980
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity

1011
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,810
in the magnetic containment field.

1012
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,210
Mr. Krei, is there a problem?

1013
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,810
No. No problem.

1014
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,420
It's well within the parameters.

1015
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,930
Let's move forward.

1016
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,930
3, 2, 1.

1017
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,610
Cabin pressure is go.

1018
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,640
Pod engaged.

1019
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,780
Field breach! Abort!

1020
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,160
We've lost all contact with the pod.

1021
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,540
Oh, no.

1022
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,550
-It's breaking up! -The pilot is gone.

1023
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,200
Portal two is down.

1024
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,370
The magnetic containment field's down!

1025
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,630
Krei, shut it down now!

1026
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,550
I want this island sealed off!

1027
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,390
The government shut down Krei's experiment.

1028
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,340
And he's using your microbots to steal his machine back.

1029
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,480
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1030
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,350
Oh, no.

1031
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,620
Baymax, get us out of here.

1032
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,990
Go for the transmitter.

1033
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,660
Behind his mask.

1034
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,550
Baymax!

1035
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,660
All right, what's the plan?

1036
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,220
It's Fred time.

1037
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,290
Super jump!

1038
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,970
Gravity crush!

1039
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,500
Falling hard.

1040
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,350
Seriously, what is the plan?

1041
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,890
-Get the mask. -Right behind you.

1042
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,100
For real, what is the plan?

1043
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,010
Hey!

1044
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,900
You want to dance, masked man?

1045
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,780
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.

1046
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,900
Hand over the mask, or you'll get a taste of this!

1047
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,160
And a little bit of that!

1048
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,580
Hey! I did all right.

1049
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,670
Is that all you got?

1050
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,250
You got that, too?

1051
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,420
It's back into the fire!

1052
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,240
It's over, Krei.

1053
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,380
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1054
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,790
The explosion...

1055
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,130
You died.

1056
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,800
No. I had your microbots.

1057
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,800
But, Tadashi.

1058
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,070
You just let him die.

1059
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,480
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1060
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,110
He went in there to save you!

1061
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,650
That was his mistake!

1062
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,790
Baymax, destroy.

1063
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,250
My programing prevents me from injuring a human being.

1064
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,700
Not anymore.

1065
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,630
Hiro, this is not what...

1066
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,510
Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!

1067
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,010
No! Stop, Baymax!

1068
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,900
No, stop! He's getting away!

1069
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,740
Baymax!

1070
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,100
My healthcare protocol has been violated.

1071
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,870
I regret any distress I may have caused.

1072
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,360
How could you do that? I had him!

1073
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,360
What you just did, we never signed up for.

1074
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,710
We said we'd catch the guy.

1075
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:31,950
That's it.

1076
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,080
I never should have let you help me!

1077
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,040
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1078
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,220
My enhanced scanner has been damaged.

1079
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,670
Wings.

1080
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,050
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1081
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,550
Fly!

1082
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,340
Hiro!

1083
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,740
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1084
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,170
You appear to be distressed.

1085
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,870
I'm fine!

1086
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,870
There. Is it working?

1087
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,800
- My sensor is operational. - Good.

1088
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,590
Then let's get...

1089
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,290
What?

1090
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,600
Are you going to remove my healthcare chip?

1091
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,420
Yes. Open!

1092
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,510
My purpose is to heal the sick and injured.

1093
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,680
Baymax, open your access port.

1094
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,470
Do you want me to terminate Professor Callaghan?

1095
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,610
Just open!

1096
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,670
Will terminating Professor Callaghan

1097
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,520
improve your emotional state?

1098
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,910
Yes! No! I don't know!

1099
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,150
Open your access!

1100
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,660
- Is this what Tadashi wanted? - It doesn't matter!

1101
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,080
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1102
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,460
Tadashi's gone!

1103
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,380
Tadashi's gone.

1104
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,510
Tadashi is here.

1105
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,050
No. He's not here.

1106
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,090
Tadashi is here.

1107
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,090
This is Tadashi Hamada.

1108
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,940
And this is the first test of my robotics project.

1109
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,440
Hello, I am Baymax.

1110
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,240
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1111
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,370
The seventh test of my robotics project.

1112
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,790
Hello, I...

1113
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,120
What? What?

1114
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,410
Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop scan! Stop...

1115
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,990
Tadashi Hamada again,

1116
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:43,420
and this is the 33rd test of my robotics project.

1117
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,100
I'm not giving up on you.

1118
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,880
You don't understand this yet, but people need you.

1119
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,730
So, let's get back to work.

1120
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,010
This is Tadashi Hamada,

1121
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,650
and this is the 84th test.

1122
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,450
What do you say, big guy?

1123
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,070
Hello, I am Baymax,

1124
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,160
your personal healthcare companion.

1125
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,440
It works.

1126
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,830
It works!

1127
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:17,500
This is amazing! You... you work!

1128
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,090
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.

1129
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,370
I knew it. Oh, you work. I can't believe it! I can't...

1130
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,010
Okay. All right, big moment, here.

1131
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,390
Scan me.

1132
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:32,310
Your neurotransmitter levels are elevated.

1133
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,590
This indicates that you are happy.

1134
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:37,140
I am. I really am.

1135
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,180
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.

1136
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,100
You're gonna help so many people, buddy.

1137
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,850
So many.

1138
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,730
That's all for now. I am satisfied with my care.

1139
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,790
Thank you, Baymax.

1140
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,840
I'm so sorry.

1141
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,540
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1142
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,550
Hiro.

1143
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,060
Guys, I, I...

1144
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,980
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1145
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,360
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1146
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,290
But maybe don't leave your team

1147
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,240
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1148
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,240
- Oh, man. - Nah, it's cool.

1149
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,460
Heathcliff picked us up in the family chopper.

1150
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,410
Hiro, we found something you should see.

1151
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,750
You almost got us all killed!

1152
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,090
Krei! You did this!

1153
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,040
You knew it wasn't ready!

1154
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,970
Callaghan? He was there?

1155
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,270
He was such a good man. What happened?

1156
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,730
I don't know.

1157
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,690
But the answer's here somewhere.

1158
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,350
Wait, wait! Stop.

1159
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,140
There he is.

1160
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
With the pilot.

1161
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:11,400
Hang on.

1162
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,480
We've invited all these people...

1164
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,740
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1165
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,950
Callaghan blames Krei.

1166
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,570
This is a revenge story.

1167
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,670
So, what are we waiting for?

1168
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,670
It's all set up.

1169
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:38,340
This beautiful new campus is the culmination of a lifelong dream.

1170
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:41,130
But none of this would've been possible

1171
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,600
without a few bumps in the road.

1172
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:47,670
Those setbacks made us stronger,

1174
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,530
and set us on the path to a bright future.

1175
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,110
What is that?

1176
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,600
- What? - Setback?

1177
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,490
Was my daughter a "Setback"?

1178
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,920
Callaghan! But you...

1179
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,010
Your daughter, that...

1180
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,500
That was an accident.

1181
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,540
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1182
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,270
My daughter is gone because of your arrogance.

1183
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,140
What are you doing?

1184
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,140
You took everything from me

1185
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,450
when you sent Abigail into that machine.

1186
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,250
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1187
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,580
No!

1188
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,330
No! No! You can't!

1189
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,060
You're going to watch everything you've built disappear.

1190
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,810
Then, it's your turn.

1191
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,670
Professor Callaghan!

1192
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,320
Let him go!

1193
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,280
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1194
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,190
Abigail is gone!

1195
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,530
This won't change anything. Trust me, I know.

1196
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,400
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1197
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,620
Please, let me go.

1198
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,790
I'll give you anything you want!

1199
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,420
I want my daughter back!

1200
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,290
Go for the mask!

1201
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,570
Baymax!

1202
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,230
Leaping into action!

1203
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,680
Oh, no!

1204
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,510
Getting a little... A little tight.

1205
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,780
- No! - He's too strong!

1206
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,130
- There's no way out! - You can't beat him!

1207
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,620
Help! I can't beat him.

1208
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,050
Hiro!

1209
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,470
- Hiro? Hiro? - Help!

1210
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,180
- That's it! - Hiro.

1211
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,590
- I know how to beat him. - Hiro.

1212
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,640
Listen up!

1213
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,050
Use those big brains of yours,

1214
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,600
and think your way around the problem.

1215
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,170
Look for a new angle.

1216
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,230
My arms! They can't go any further!

1217
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,750
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1218
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,620
Hello, sign.

1219
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,120
Care to go for a little spin?

1220
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,750
Double spin!

1221
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:36,910
Behind-the-back spin!

1222
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,770
Baymax!

1223
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,780
Hiro.

1224
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,130
I love that robot!

1225
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,130
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.

1226
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,560
Take out the bots. They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1227
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,230
Now that is a plan!

1228
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,430
Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover?

1229
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,400
Like you have to ask.

1230
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,640
Let's do this, Freddie!

1231
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,610
Smokescreen!

1232
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,150
Ready and

1233
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,250
dive!

1234
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,210
Whoa, the gravity's getting a little weird here, guys!

1235
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,760
Wait. Let's use this!

1236
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,850
These are green blades of fury!

1237
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,800
Woman up!

1238
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,890
Double sign-spin.

1239
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,280
Now my signs are on fire!

1240
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,630
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1241
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:45,220
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1242
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,750
Hammerfist.

1243
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,380
This ends now!

1244
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,070
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1245
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,310
What?

1246
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,410
Baymax!

1247
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,240
No!

1248
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,210
Our programing prevents us from injuring a human being.

1249
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,800
But we'll take that.

1250
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,540
It's still on! We have to shut it down!

1251
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,000
We can't! The containment field is failing.

1252
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,420
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1253
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,290
We need to get out of here, now!

1254
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,970
Baymax!

1255
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,350
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1256
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,380
- What? - Coming from there.

1257
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,310
The life signs are female.

1258
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,730
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1259
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,070
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.

1260
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,610
Abigail.

1261
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,440
Let's go get her.

1262
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,320
The portal is destabilizing. You'll never make it.

1263
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:36,490
She's alive in there.

1264
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,370
Someone has to help.

1265
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,280
What do you say, buddy?

1266
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,160
Flying makes me a better healthcare companion.

1267
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,940
Careful! There's Krei tech debris everywhere.

1268
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,120
Look out!

1269
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,430
I have located the patient.

1270
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,680
Hurry!

1271
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,920
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1272
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,540
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1273
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,090
Veer right!

1274
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,020
Okay, to the left.

1275
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,230
Hard right!

1276
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,680
Up and over.

1277
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,270
Okay, level off. Easy.

1278
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,440
Nice flying!

1279
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,360
Almost there!

1280
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,630
Baymax!

1281
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:00,220
Baymax!

1282
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,300
My thrusters are inoperable.

1283
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,430
Just grab hold.

1284
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:24,400
There is still a way I can get you both to safety.

1285
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,330
I cannot deactivate until you say

1286
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,450
you are satisfied with your care.

1287
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,950
No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you?

1288
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,830
- You are my patient. - Baymax.

1289
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,420
Your health is my only concern.

1290
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,170
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1291
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,920
Are you satisfied with your care?

1292
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,850
No. There's gotta be another way.

1293
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,970
I'm not gonna leave you here. I'll think of something.

1294
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,520
There is no time.

1295
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,430
Are you satisfied with your care?

1296
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,140
Please! No.

1297
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,320
I can't lose you, too.

1298
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,780
Hiro, I will always be with you.

1299
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,890
I'm satisfied with my care.

1300
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,930
Hiro!

1301
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,100
Yeah! They made it!

1302
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,060
Baymax?

1303
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:31,750
Miss, can you hear me?

1304
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,460
What is your name?

1305
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,570
Abigail Callaghan.

1306
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,380
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.

1307
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,800
We're taking you to the hospital.

1308
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,040
Move it!

1309
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,550
Get in there.

1310
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,150
A massive cleanup continues today

1311
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,320
at the headquarters of Krei Tech Industries.

1313
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:06,730
Reports are still flooding in

1314
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,830
about a group of unidentified individuals,

1315
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,110
who prevented what could have been a major catastrophe.

1316
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,820
The whole city of San Fransokyo is asking,

1317
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,320
"Who are these heroes? And where are they now?"

1318
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,080
It's so exciting.

1319
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:22,510
Hey, sweetie!

1320
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,760
Okay.

1321
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,340
Last hug.

1322
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:31,680
Bye!

1323
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,340
- And just then I was like... - Get out of here.

1324
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,720
I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.

1325
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,530
Hello, Hiro.

1326
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,700
We didn't set out to be superheroes,

1327
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:43,080
but sometimes life doesn't go the way you planned.

1328
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,260
The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people,

1329
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,000
and that's what we're gonna do.

1330
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,720
Who are we?

1334
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:26,440
Dad, I just wish I could share my accomplishments with you.

1335
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:28,450
You mean so much to me, and honestly,

1336
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,940
I've always felt a distance

1337
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:33,360
what with you being on the family island all the time,

1338
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,730
and I just wish you could see how...

1339
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,130
Fred.

1340
01:40:58,970 --> 01:40:59,970
Son.

1341
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:01,940
Dad?

1342
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:08,310
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.

1343
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:13,620
I go inside out, then I go front and back.

1344
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:14,990
Dad!

1345
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,290
We have a lot to talk about.

2
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,980
Get up! Get up!

3
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,460
The winner,

4
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,720
by total annihilation,

5
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,680
Yama!

6
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,020
Who is next?

7
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Who has the guts to step into the ring with little Yama?

8
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,180
Yama!

9
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,730
Can I try?

10
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,150
I have a robot. I built it myself.

11
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,120
Beat it, kid.

12
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,040
House rules. You gotta pay to play.

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,500
Is this enough?

14
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,540
What's your name, little boy?

15
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,340
Hiro. Hiro Hamada.

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,090
Prepare your bot, zero.

17
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,560
Two bots enter,

18
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,860
one bot leaves.

19
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,990
Fighters ready?

20
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,270
Fight!

21
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,340
That was my first fight. I... Can I try again?

22
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,370
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

23
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,250
Go home.

24
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,870
I've got more money.

25
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,340
Fighters ready?

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,980
Fight!

27
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,260
Mega-bot, destroy.

28
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,820
What?

29
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,630
- No more little Yama. - But, wha...

30
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,420
This is not possible!

31
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,230
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

32
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,800
Beginner's luck.

33
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,310
Do you want to go again, Yama?

34
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,280
No one hustles Yama!

35
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,860
Teach him a lesson.

36
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,980
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.

37
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,950
- Hiro! Get on! - Tadashi!

38
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,620
Good timing!

39
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,830
Oh, mama!

40
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,540
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,890
- Are you hurt? - No.

42
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,010
Then what were you thinking, knucklehead?

43
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,770
You graduated high school when you were 13,

44
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,890
and this is what you're doing?

45
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
There they are!

46
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,530
Hold on!

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,770
Yes!

48
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,310
Get back here.

49
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,440
Bot fighting is illegal.

50
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,240
You're going to get yourself arrested.

51
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Bot fighting is not illegal.

52
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,910
Betting on bot fighting, that's... that's illegal.

53
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,170
But so lucrative!

54
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,630
I'm on a roll, big brother! And there is no stopping me!

55
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Oh, no.

57
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,980
Hi, Aunt Cass.

58
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,050
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.

59
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,610
- We're fine. - We're okay.

60
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,930
Oh, good.

61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,030
Then what were you two knuckleheads thinking?

62
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
For 10 years,

63
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,660
I have done the best I could to raise you.

64
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,520
Have I been perfect? No.

65
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,580
Do I know anything about children? No.

66
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,490
Should I have picked up a book on parenting?

67
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,830
Probably!

68
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,120
Where was I going with this? I had a point.

69
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,380
- Sorry. - We love you, Aunt Cass.

70
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,910
Well, I love you, too!

71
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,010
I had to close up early because of you two felons.

72
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,290
On beat poetry night.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,090
Stress eating. Because of you.

74
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,340
Come on, Mochi.

75
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,470
This is really good!

76
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,820
You better make this up to Aunt Cass

77
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,340
before she eats everything in the cafe.

78
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,640
For sure.

79
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,940
And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.

80
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,970
Absolutely.

81
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,860
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

82
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,320
There's a fight across town. If I book, I can still make it.

83
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,730
When are you gonna

84
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,780
start doing something with that big brain of yours?

85
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,700
What? Go to college like you?

86
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,580
So people can tell me stuff I already know?

87
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,420
Unbelievable.

88
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,030
What would mom and dad say?

89
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,300
I don't know.

90
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,010
They're gone.

91
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,380
They died when I was three, remember?

92
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,130
- I'll take you. - Really?

93
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,420
I can't stop you from going,

94
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,880
but I'm not going to let you go on your own.

95
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,190
Sweet.

97
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,860
What are we doing at your nerd school?

98
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,560
Bot-fight's that way!

100
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,110
Gotta grab something.

101
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,810
Is this gonna take long?

102
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,280
Relax, you big baby. We'll be in and out.

103
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,910
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,750
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

105
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,990
Heads up!

106
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,640
Electro-mag suspension?

107
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,270
- Who are you? - I'm...

108
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,350
Go go, this is my brother Hiro.

109
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,990
Welcome to the nerd lab.

110
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Yeah.

111
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,660
I've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.

112
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,330
Zero resistance, faster bike.

113
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,160
But, not fast enough,

114
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,710
yet.

115
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,170
Do not move. Behind the line, please.

116
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,970
Hey, Wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.

117
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,560
Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.

118
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,630
Catch.

119
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,610
- Laser-induced plasma? - Oh, yeah.

120
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,610
With a little magnetic confinement for ultra-precision.

121
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,820
Wow. How do you find anything in this mess?

122
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,820
I have a system.

123
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,950
There's a place for everything,

124
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,900
and everything in its place.

125
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,410
- Need this! - You can't do that!

126
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,610
This is anarchy! Society has rules!

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,460
Excuse me!

128
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,070
Coming through!

129
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,740
Tadashi!

130
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,870
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

131
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I've heard so much about you!

132
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,290
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

133
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,890
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

134
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,630
400 pounds of it!

135
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,960
Come here, come here, come here.

136
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,760
You're going to love this.

137
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,050
A dash of perchloric acid, a smidge of cobalt,

138
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,730
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

139
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,350
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...

140
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,810
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

141
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,360
It's so pink.

142
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,280
Here's the best part.

143
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,040
I know, right?

144
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,410
Chemical metal embrittlement.

145
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,050
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

146
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,830
"Honey Lemon"? "Go go"? "Wasabi"?

147
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,050
I spill wasabi on my shirt one time, people.

148
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,510
One time!

149
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,810
Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.

150
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,350
Who's Fred?

151
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,930
This guy, right here!

152
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,650
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,190
This is not my real face and body.

154
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,470
The name's Fred.

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,520
School mascot by day, but by night,

156
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,650
I am also a school mascot.

157
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,200
So, what's your major?

158
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,740
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

159
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,910
But I am a major science enthusiast.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,120
I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula,

161
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,250
that can turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will.

162
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,660
But she says that's "Not science."

163
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,910
It's really not.

164
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,630
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

165
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,590
I asked Wasabi for isn't "Science" either.

166
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,790
- Is it? - Nope.

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,630
Well, then, what about "Invisible sandwich"?

168
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,840
- Hiro. - Imagine eating a sandwich,

169
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,920
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

170
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,050
Just stop.

171
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,340
- Laser eyes? - What?

172
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,220
- Tingly fingers? - Never gonna happen.

173
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,470
Hey, what about a growth serum?

174
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,610
So, what have you been working on?

175
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,930
I'll show you.

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,060
Duct tape?

177
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,020
I hate to break it to you, bro.

178
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,310
Already been invented.

179
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,870
Dude!

180
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Ow!

181
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,170
This is what I've been working on.

182
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
Hello. I am Baymax.

183
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,240
Your personal healthcare companion.

184
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,700
I was alerted to the need

185
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,160
for medical attention when you said, "Ow."

186
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,440
A robotic nurse.

187
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,490
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

188
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,490
Physical or emotional?

189
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,790
I will scan you now.

190
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,160
Scan complete.

191
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,880
You have a slight epidermal abrasion on your forearm.

192
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,590
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

193
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,260
What's in the spray, specifically?

194
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,350
The primary ingredient is Bacitracin.

195
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,020
That's a bummer. I'm actually allergic to that.

196
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,110
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

197
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,650
You do have a mild allergy to peanuts.

198
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,350
Not bad.

199
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,030
You've done some serious coding on this thing, huh?

200
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,150
Programed him with over 10,000 medical procedures.

202
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,830
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.

203
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,670
Vinyl?

204
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,960
Yeah, going for a non-threatening, huggable kind of thing.

205
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,170
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

206
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,800
- No offense. - I am a robot.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,210
I cannot be offended.

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,390
- Hyperspectral cameras? -Yep.

209
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,100
- Titanium skeleton? - Carbon fiber.

210
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,440
Right. Even lighter.

211
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,890
Killer actuators. Where did you get those?

212
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,640
Machined them right here, in-house.

213
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,030
- Really? - Yup.

214
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,690
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

215
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Shut up.

216
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,520
You have been a good boy. Have a lollipop.

217
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,870
Nice.

218
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,090
I cannot deactivate until you say

219
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,450
you are satisfied with your care.

220
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,450
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

221
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,580
He's going to help a lot of people.

222
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,700
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

223
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Lithium ion.

224
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,720
You know, supercapacitors would charge way faster.

225
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,960
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?

226
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,050
Hey, Professor.

227
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,090
Actually, I was just finishing up.

228
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,390
You must be Hiro.

229
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,050
Bot-fighter, right?

230
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,900
When my daughter was younger, that's all she wanted to do.

231
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,140
May I?

232
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,600
Sure.

233
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,070
Magnetic-bearing servos.

234
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,450
Pretty sick, huh?

235
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,770
Wanna see how I put 'em together?

236
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,330
Hey, genius!

237
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,280
He invented them.

238
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,740
You're Robert Callaghan?

239
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,570
Like, as in,

240
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,450
the Callaghan-catmull spline,

241
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,080
and Callaghan's "Laws of robotics"?

242
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,290
That's right.

243
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,120
Ever think about applying here?

244
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,670
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

245
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I don't know.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,250
He's pretty serious about his career in bot-fighting.

247
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,750
Well, kind of serious.

248
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,970
I can see why.

249
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,090
With your bot, winning must come easy.

250
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,010
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,200
Well, if you like things easy,

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,520
then my program isn't for you.

253
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,020
We push the boundaries of robotics here.

254
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,650
My students go on to shape the future.

255
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,450
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

256
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,030
Good luck with the bot-fights.

257
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,950
We gotta hurry if you want to catch that bot-fight.

258
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,750
I have to go here.

259
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,460
If I don't go to this nerd school,

260
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,830
I'm gonna lose my mind.

261
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
How do I get in?

263
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,220
Every year, the school has a student showcase.

264
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,200
You come up with something that blows Callaghan away,

265
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,930
you're in.

266
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,720
But, it's gotta be great.

268
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,140
Trust me.

269
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,300
It will be.

270
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,730
Nothing!

271
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,990
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!

272
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,330
Wow. Washed up at 14.

273
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,450
So sad.

274
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,330
I got nothing! I'm done. I'm never getting in.

275
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,340
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.

276
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,380
What are you doing?

277
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,840
Shake things up.

278
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,340
Use that big brain of yours to think your way out.

279
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,510
- What? - Look for a new angle.

280
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,210
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.

281
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,550
How are you feeling?

282
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,380
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.

283
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,230
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

284
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,440
Yep, he's nervous.

285
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,890
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

286
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,730
- He's so tense. - No, I'm not.

287
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,400
Relax, Hiro.

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,310
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go go.

289
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,040
Stop whining. Woman up.

290
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm fine!

291
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,560
What do you need, little man? Deodorant? Breath mint?

292
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Fresh pair of underpants?

293
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,790
Underpants? You need serious help.

294
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey, I come prepared.

295
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,110
I haven't done laundry in six months.

296
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,420
One pair lasts me four days.

297
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,570
I go front, I go back,

298
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,740
I go inside-out. Then I go front and back.

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,170
Wow. That is both disgusting and awesome.

300
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,510
Don't encourage him.

301
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,080
It's called "Recycling."

302
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,850
Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.

303
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,800
Oh, yeah. This is it.

304
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,970
I guess I'm up.

305
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,260
Okay, photo, photo! Everybody say, "Hiro."

306
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,840
- Hiro! - Yeah!

307
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,600
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

308
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,190
- Don't mess it up. - Break a leg, little man.

309
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,820
Science, yeah!

310
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,100
All right, bro. This is it.

311
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,700
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

312
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,780
What's going on?

313
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,330
I really want to go here.

314
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
You got this.

315
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,290
My name is Hiro...

316
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,930
Sorry.

317
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,770
My name is Hiro Hamada,

318
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,310
and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool.

319
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,310
I hope you like it.

320
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,150
This is a microbot.

321
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,460
Breathe.

322
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,660
It doesn't look like much,

323
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,040
but when it links up with the rest of its pals,

324
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,510
things get a little more interesting.

325
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,910
The microbots are controlled with this neural transmitter.

326
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,530
I think what I want them to do...

327
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,580
They do it.

328
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,870
The applications for this tech are limitless.

329
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,510
Construction.

330
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,340
What used to take teams of people working by hand

331
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,760
for months or years,

332
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,560
can now be accomplished by one person.

333
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,050
And that's just the beginning.

334
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,760
How about transportation?

335
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,390
Microbots can move anything anywhere,

336
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,200
with ease.

337
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,580
If you can think it, the microbots can do it.

338
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
The only limit is your imagination.

339
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,930
Microbots!

340
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,390
That's my nephew!

341
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,690
Yes!

342
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,480
My family! I love my family!

343
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,270
Nailed it!

344
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,270
- You did it! - Not bad!

345
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,280
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!

346
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,770
They loved you. That was amazing!

347
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,280
Yes.

348
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,580
With some development, your tech could be revolutionary.

349
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,820
Alistair Krei!

350
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,460
May I?

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,130
Extraordinary.

352
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,470
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

353
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,170
Shut up.

354
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,830
Mr. Krei is right.

355
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,840
Your microbots are an inspired piece of tech.

356
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,630
You can continue to develop them,

357
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,310
or you can sell them to a man

358
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,520
who's only guided by his own self-interest.

359
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,440
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

360
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,680
but it shouldn't affect...

361
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,470
This is your decision, Hiro.

362
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,690
But you should know

363
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,650
Mr. Krei has cut corners and ignored sound science

364
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
to get where he is.

365
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,150
That's just not true.

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,060
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech

367
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,870
with your microbots,

368
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,500
or anything else.

369
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,420
Hiro, I'm offering you

370
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,030
more money than any 14-year-old could imagine.

371
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,060
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,

372
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,460
but they're not for sale.

373
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,390
I thought you were smarter than that.

374
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,960
Robert.

375
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,060
Mr. Krei.

376
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,390
That's my brother's.

377
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,860
That's right.

378
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,200
I look forward to seeing you in class.

379
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,870
Unbelievable!

380
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,150
That's what I'm talking about.

381
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,960
All right, geniuses,

382
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,370
let's feed those hungry brains.

383
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Back to the cafe!

384
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,880
Dinner is on me!

385
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,880
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

386
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,870
- Aunt Cass? - Unless it's moldy.

387
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,370
We'll... we'll catch up, okay?

388
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,720
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

389
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,590
Both of you.

390
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,930
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

391
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,270
I know what you're going to say.

392
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,190
"I should be proud of myself,"

393
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,110
"because I'm finally using my gift for something important."

394
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,270
No, no. I was just gonna

395
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,030
tell you your fly was down for the whole show.

396
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,110
Ha-ha-hilarious.

397
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,080
What?

398
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,130
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

399
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,450
Hey, I...

400
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,430
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. So,

401
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,430
you know,

402
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,430
thanks for not giving up on me.

403
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,100
Are you okay?

404
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,780
Yeah. I'm okay.

405
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,570
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.

406
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,440
Tadashi, no!

407
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,420
Callaghan's in there.

408
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,790
Someone has to help.

409
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,810
Tadashi!

410
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,480
Tadashi!

411
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,040
Here. Have some tea.

412
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,240
Hey, sweetie.

413
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,690
Hey, Aunt Cass.

414
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,620
Mrs. Matsuda's in the cafe.

415
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,080
She's wearing something super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.

416
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,410
That always cracks you up.

417
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,580
You should come down.

418
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,960
Maybe later.

419
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,050
The university called again.

420
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,290
It's been a few weeks since classes started.

421
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,710
But they said it's not too late to register.

422
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,470
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.

424
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,950
Hey, Hiro.

425
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,820
We just wanted to check in, and see how you're doing.

426
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,090
We wish you were here, buddy.

427
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,120
Hiro, if I could have only one superpower right now,

428
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,670
it would be the ability to crawl through this camera,

429
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,130
and give you a big hug.

430
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Ow!

431
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,060
Hello. I am Baymax,

432
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,020
your personal healthcare companion.

433
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,020
Hey, Baymax.

434
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,860
I didn't know you were still active.

435
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,030
I heard a sound of distress.

436
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,650
What seems to be the trouble?

437
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,750
I just stubbed my toe a little.

438
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm fine.

439
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,200
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

440
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,210
A zero. I'm okay, really.

441
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,290
Thanks. You can shrink now.

442
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,970
Does it hurt when I touch it?

443
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,930
That's okay. No touching.

444
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,590
I'm fine...

445
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,050
You have fallen.

446
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,230
You think?

447
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,740
- On a scale of 1 to... - Ow!

448
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,100
On a scale...

449
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,270
On a sca...

450
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,620
On a scale of 1 to 10...

451
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,280
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

452
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,080
Zero.

453
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,450
- It is all right to cry. - No. No, no, no, no.

454
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,240
Crying is a natural response to pain.

455
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,410
I'm not crying.

456
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,910
- I will scan you for injuries. - Don't scan me.

457
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,750
- Scan complete. - Unbelievable.

458
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,760
You have sustained no injuries.

459
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,420
However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels

460
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,420
indicate that you are experiencing mood swings,

461
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,800
common in adolescence.

462
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,420
Diagnosis, puberty.

463
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,770
What?

464
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,350
Okay. Time to shrink now.

465
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,470
You should expect an increase in body hair,

466
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,110
especially on your face, chest, armpits, and...

467
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,490
Thank you! That's enough.

468
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,270
You may also experience strange and powerful new urges.

469
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,280
Okay! Let's get you back in your luggage.

470
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,510
I cannot deactivate until you say

471
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,450
you are satisfied with your care.

472
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,120
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

473
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,470
My microbot?

474
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,960
This doesn't make any sense.

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,430
Puberty can often be a confusing time

476
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,650
for a young adolescent flowering into manhood.

477
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,640
No. The thing is attracted to the other microbots,

478
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,640
but that's impossible.

479
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,810
They were destroyed in the fire.

480
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,990
Dumb thing's broken.

481
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,160
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

482
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,340
Oh, yeah?

483
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,010
Why don't you find out where it's trying to go?

484
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,660
Would that stabilize your pubescent mood swings?

485
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,220
Absolutely.

486
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,180
Baymax?

487
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,350
Baymax?

488
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,650
Baymax?

489
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,410
What?

490
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,540
- Hiro? - Hey, Aunt Cass!

491
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,910
Wow. You're up and...

492
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,870
Yeah! I figured it was time.

493
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,910
Are you registering for school?

494
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Yes.

495
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,950
I thought about what you said. Really inspired me.

496
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,380
Oh, honey, that's so great.

497
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,880
Okay,

498
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,300
special dinner tonight.

499
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,800
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

500
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,390
You know, with the hot sauce that makes our faces numb.

501
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,220
- Okay, sounds good. - Great!

502
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,890
Last hug.

503
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,070
Baymax!

504
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,240
Baymax!

505
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Watch it!

506
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,810
Baymax!

507
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,280
Baymax!

508
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,110
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

509
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,860
I have found where your tiny robot wants to go.

510
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,460
I told you, it's broken. It's not trying to go...

511
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,670
Locked.

512
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,890
There is a window.

513
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,840
Please exercise caution.

514
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,400
A fall from this height could lead to bodily harm.

515
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,380
Oh, no.

516
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,380
Excuse me while I let out some air.

517
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
Are you done?

518
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,350
Yes.

519
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,110
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

520
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,680
Fine, just keep it down.

521
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,570
My microbots?

522
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,120
Someone's making more.

523
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,340
Hiro?

524
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,750
You gave me a heart attack!

525
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,090
My hands are equipped with defibrillators. Clear.

526
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,920
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression.

527
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,300
Oh, no.

528
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,640
Run!

529
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,810
Oh, come on!

530
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,310
I am not fast.

531
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,940
Yeah, no kidding!

532
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,610
Go! Go! Come on.

533
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,030
Kick it down!

534
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,950
Then punch it!

535
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,130
Go! Go!

536
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,500
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

537
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Move it!

538
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,800
Come on!

539
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,320
No, no.

540
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,410
Come on! The window!

541
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,490
Suck it in!

542
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,340
Baymax!

543
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,000
Hiro?

544
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,100
Come on, let's get out of here.

545
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,020
Go! Hurry!

546
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,100
All right, let me get this straight.

547
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,200
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

548
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,520
with an army of miniature flying robots.

549
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,190
"Microbots."

550
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,370
-Microbots. -Yeah.

551
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,910
He was controlling them

552
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,280
telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter.

553
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,210
So, Mr. Kabuki was using esp

554
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,050
to attack you and balloon man.

555
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,820
Did you file a report when your flying robots were stolen?

556
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,090
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

557
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,620
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

558
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,330
but Baymax was there, too.

559
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,470
-Tell him. -Yes, officer.

560
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,420
He's telling the truth.

561
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,760
What the... What's wrong with you?

562
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,600
Low battery.

563
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,430
Try to keep it together.

564
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,610
I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion.

565
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,300
Kid, how about we call your parents,

566
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,610
and get them down here?

567
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,940
What?

568
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,690
Write your name and number down

569
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,290
on this piece of paper, and we can...

570
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,130
I've gotta get you home to your charging station.

571
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Can you walk?

572
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,120
I will scan you now. Scan complete.

573
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,680
Healthcare.

574
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Okay.

575
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,390
If my aunt asks, we were at school all day. Got it?

576
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,890
We jumped out a window.

577
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,780
No! Quiet!

578
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,660
We jumped out a window.

579
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,980
You can't say things like that around aunt Cass.

580
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,340
Hiro?

581
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,660
You home, sweetie?

582
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,680
That's right.

583
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,380
I thought I heard you.

584
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,670
Hey, aunt Cass.

585
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,010
Look at my little college man.

586
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,230
I can't wait to hear all about it!

587
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,510
And wings are almost ready.

588
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Whee!

589
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Will you be quiet?

590
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,680
Yeah, wings! Whee!

591
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,570
All right, get ready to have your face melted.

592
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,690
We are gonna feel these things tomorrow.

593
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,190
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Okay.

595
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,870
Sit down. Tell me everything.

596
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,630
The thing is that, since I registered so late,

597
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,120
I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.

598
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,580
What was that?

599
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,380
Mochi.

600
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,890
That darn cat.

601
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,560
At least take a plate for the road, okay?

602
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,890
-Don't work too... -Thanks for understanding.

603
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:39,060
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

604
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,360
All right, come on.

605
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm healthcare, your personal baymax companion.

606
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,690
One foot in front of the other.

607
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,680
This doesn't make any sense.

608
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,210
Tadashi.

609
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,340
What?

610
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,020
Tadashi.

611
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,980
Tadashi's gone.

612
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,400
When will he return?

613
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,820
He's dead, baymax.

614
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,660
Tadashi was in excellent health.

615
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,900
With a proper diet and exercise,

616
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,960
he should have lived a long life.

617
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,910
Yeah, he should have.

618
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,380
But there was a fire and...

619
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,540
Now, he's gone.

620
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,050
-Tadashi is here. -No.

621
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,680
People keep saying he's not really gone.

622
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,140
As long as we remember him.

623
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,640
It still hurts.

624
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,640
I see no evidence of physical injury.

625
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,570
It's a different kind of hurt.

626
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,870
You are my patient.

627
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,310
I would like to help.

628
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,480
You can't fix this one, buddy.

629
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,410
What are you doing?

630
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,740
I am downloading a database on personal loss.

631
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,450
Database downloaded.

632
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,050
Treatments include contact with friends and loved ones.

637
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,500
I am contacting them now.

638
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,170
No, no, no! I... Don't do that.

639
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,630
Your friends have been contacted.

640
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
Unbelievable.

641
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,430
Now, what are you doing?

642
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,390
Other treatments include compassion and physical reassurance.

643
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,900
I'm okay. Really.

644
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,140
You will be all right. There, there.

645
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,820
Thanks, Baymax.

646
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,450
I am sorry about the fire.

647
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,570
It's okay. It was an accident.

648
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,870
Unless...

649
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,210
Unless it wasn't.

650
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,700
At the showcase,

651
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,380
that guy in the mask stole my microbots. And...

652
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,090
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.

653
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,170
He's responsible for Tadashi.

654
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,600
We gotta catch that guy.

655
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,840
It's alive!

656
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,440
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!

657
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,810
If we're gonna catch that guy,

658
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,610
you need some upgrades.

659
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,770
Will apprehending the man

660
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,360
in the mask improve your emotional state?

661
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,190
Absolutely.

662
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,000
Let's work on your moves.

663
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,090
Now, let's take care of this.

664
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,040
I have some concerns.

665
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,060
This armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.

666
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,960
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

668
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,890
You look sick.

669
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,270
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

670
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,010
It's just an expression.

671
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,270
Data transfer complete.

673
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,330
I fail to see

674
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,920
how karate makes me a better healthcare companion.

675
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,590
You want to keep me healthy, don't you?

676
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,960
Punch this.

677
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,840
Yes! Hammerfist!

678
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,600
Side kick!

679
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,970
Knifehand!

680
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,610
Back kick!

681
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,690
Gummy bears!

682
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,120
Yes!

683
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,330
Yeah! Fist bump!

684
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,220
"Fist bump" Is not in my fighting database.

685
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,800
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

686
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,140
It's what people do sometimes

687
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,930
when they're excited or pumped up.

688
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,060
Hey, now you're getting it.

689
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,780
I will add "Fist bump" to my care-giving matrix.

690
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,280
All right. Let's go get that guy.

691
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,370
Come on!

692
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,350
Get him, Baymax!

693
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,780
We're too late.

694
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,520
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

695
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,450
Come on.

696
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,880
Always wait one hour after eating before swimming.

697
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,400
Come on!

698
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,320
Your heart rate has increased dramatic...

699
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,050
Okay, Baymax, time to use those upgrades.

700
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,440
-Hiro? -No, no, no!

701
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,890
Get out of here! Go!

702
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,640
Dude, what are you doing out here?

703
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,270
Nothing! Just out for a walk.

704
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,100
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

705
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,410
Is that Baymax?

706
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,150
Yeah, but you really...

707
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,940
Why is he wearing carbon fiber underpants?

708
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,750
I also know karate.

709
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,030
You guys need to go.

710
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,890
No, don't push us away, Hiro.

711
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,080
We're here for you.

712
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,750
That's why Baymax contacted us.

713
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,250
Those who suffer a loss,

714
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,670
require support from friends and loved ones.

715
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,870
Okay, but I...

716
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,800
Who would like to share their feelings first?

717
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,460
I'll go. Okay.

718
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,130
My name is Fred, and it has been 30 days since my last...

719
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,000
Holy mother of megazon!

720
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,930
Am I the only one seeing this?

721
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,220
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

722
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,060
Go!

723
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,610
Baymax, get him!

724
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,080
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

725
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,530
I'm saving your life.

726
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,900
Baymax can handle that guy!

727
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,490
Oh, no.

728
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,420
Wasabi!

729
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,130
Goodbye!

730
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,050
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

731
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,890
He stole my microbots. He started the fire.

732
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,510
I don't know who he is!

733
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,260
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

734
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,430
Hard left!

735
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,000
That mask, the black suit...

736
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,340
We're under attack from a super villain, people!

737
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,080
I mean, how cool is that?

738
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,370
I mean, it's scary, obviously. But how cool!

739
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,970
Why are we stopped?

740
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,010
The light's red!

741
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,640
There are no red lights in a car chase!

742
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,590
Why is he trying to kill us?

743
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,970
Why are you trying to kill us?

744
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,940
It's classic villain. We've seen too much!

745
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,320
Let's not jump to conclusions.

746
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,310
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

747
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,610
Car!

748
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,940
He's trying to kill us!

749
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,320
Did you just put your blinker on?

750
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,900
You have to indicate your turn!

751
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,190
It's the law!

752
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,250
That's it.

753
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,990
Stop the car!

754
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,320
Baymax and I can take this guy!

755
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,660
Seatbelts save lives.

756
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,290
Buckle up, every time.

757
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,000
What are you doing? What are you doing?

758
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,140
What are you doing? What are you doing?

759
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,850
-Did we lose him? -Look out!

760
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,440
Baymax, hold on!

761
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,040
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

762
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,400
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

763
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,240
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

764
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,250
We made it! Yes!

765
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,780
I told you we'd make it!

766
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
Your injuries require my attention.

767
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,250
And your body temperatures are low.

768
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,960
We should get out of here.

769
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,010
I know a place.

770
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,040
Where are we?

771
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,880
Fred.

772
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,350
Where are you going?

773
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,510
Welcome to mi casa.

775
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,360
That's French for "Front door."

776
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,180
It's really not.

777
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,530
Listen, nitwit.

778
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,190
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

779
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,810
I'm not in the mood for any...

780
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,480
Welcome home, master Frederick.

781
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,370
Heathcliff, my man!

782
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,820
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.

783
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,120
Gimme some.

784
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,960
Freddie,

785
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,970
this is your house?

786
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,920
I thought you lived under a bridge.

787
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,960
Well, technically, it belongs to my parents.

788
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,260
They're on a vacay on the family island.

789
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,840
You know, we should totally go some time. Frolic.

790
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,640
You gotta be kidding me.

792
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,490
If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask,

793
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,160
I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today.

794
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,410
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

795
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,990
Your body temperature is still low.

796
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,030
Yeah.

797
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,580
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

798
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,420
It's so nice.

799
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,300
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

800
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,090
Good robot.

801
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,900
Does this symbol mean anything to you guys?

802
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,060
-Yes! It's a bird! -No!

803
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,290
The guy in the mask was carrying something

804
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,520
with this symbol on it.

805
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,790
Apprehending the man in

806
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,860
the mask will improve Hiro's emotional state.

807
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,620
Apprehend him?

808
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,110
We don't even know who he is.

809
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,870
I have a theory.

810
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,920
"Dr. Slaughter, md"?

811
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,160
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

812
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,620
Malcolm chazzletick.

813
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,210
"The annihilator"?

814
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,920
Behind the mask, industrialist Reid Axworthy.

815
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,130
"Baron Von destruct"? Just get to the point!

816
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,460
Don't you guys get it?

817
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,930
The man in the mask who attacked us

818
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,480
is none other than...

819
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,220
Voila!

820
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,480
Alistair krei.

821
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,180
-What? -Think about it.

822
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,810
Krei wanted your microbots, and you said no.

823
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,430
But rules don't apply to a man like krei.

824
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,480
There's no way. The guy is too high profile.

825
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,530
Then who was that guy in the mask?

826
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,330
I don't know.

827
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,540
We don't know anything about him.

828
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,990
His blood type is ab-negative.

829
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,720
-Cholesterol levels are... - Baymax,

830
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,080
you scanned him?

831
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,920
I am programed to assess everyone's healthcare needs.

832
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,500
Yes!

833
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,040
I can use the data from your scan to find him.

834
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,830
You'd have to scan everyone in San fransokyo.

835
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,010
That might take, I don't know, forever.

836
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,530
No, no, no, no. I...

837
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,880
I just have to look for another angle.

838
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,510
Got it!

839
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,530
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

840
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,230
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

841
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,710
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

842
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,670
I need to upgrade all of you.

843
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,030
Upgrade who, now?

844
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,800
Those who suffer a loss

845
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,700
require support from friends and loved ones.

846
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,240
Okay, I like where this is heading!

847
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,910
We can't go against that guy! We're nerds!

848
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,270
Hiro, we want to help,

849
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,630
but we're just us.

850
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
No.

851
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,230
You can be way more.

852
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,840
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

853
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,960
We're in.

854
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,740
Can you feel it? You guys, do you feel this?

855
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,650
Our origin story begins.

856
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,740
We're gonna be superheroes!

857
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,060
Arms up.

858
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,430
The neurotransmitter must be in his mask.

859
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,820
We get the mask, and he can't control the bots.

860
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,980
Game over.

861
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,050
They say "We are what we are"

862
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,950
But we don't have to be

863
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,680
I'm bad behavior

864
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,710
But I do it in the best way

865
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,930
I'll be the watcher

866
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,100
Of the eternal flame

867
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,500
I'll be the guard dog

868
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,560
Of all your fever dreams

869
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,990
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass

870
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,540
Cause we could be immortals

871
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,300
Immortals

872
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,620
Just not for long for long

873
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,210
Live with me forever now

874
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,700
Pull the blackout curtains down

875
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,470
Just not for long for long

876
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,720
We could be immortals

877
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,520
Immortals

878
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,720
Immortals

879
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:46,320
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith

880
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,860
Is when it's tested again and again every day

881
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,330
I'm still comparing your past to my future

882
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,210
Cause we could be immortals

883
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,780
Immortals

884
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,250
Just not for long for long

885
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,250
Super jump!

886
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,550
Super jump!

887
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,050
Pull the blackout curtains down

888
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:13,970
-I breathe fire. -Just not for long for long

889
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,270
We could be immortals

890
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,780
Immortals

891
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:28,150
Immortals

892
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:32,910
Immortals

893
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,740
Immortals

894
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,220
I love it!

895
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,440
Not bad.

896
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,440
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

897
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,560
Hey, guys!

898
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,640
Check this out.

899
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,320
I'd like to introduce,

900
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,050
Baymax 2.0.

901
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,950
He's glorious.

902
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,590
Hold up. Focus.

903
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,010
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

904
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,430
The fist, show them the fist.

905
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,600
No, not that.

906
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,520
The thing, the other thing.

907
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,870
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

908
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,400
That's just one of his new upgrades!

909
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,330
Baymax, wings.

910
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,170
No way!

911
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,800
Thrusters.

912
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,440
I fail to see how flying

913
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,690
makes me a better healthcare companion.

914
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,770
I fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome!

915
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,310
Full thrust.

916
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,740
Steady, big guy.

917
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,660
Look, let's just take this slow.

918
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,830
Up, up, up, up, up!

919
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,240
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

920
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,040
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

921
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,660
Too much thrust!

922
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
No, no, no, no!

923
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,620
Back on! Back on!

924
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,310
On! On! On!

925
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,320
Go up! Up, up, up!

926
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,970
Oh, man!

927
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,330
Maybe... Maybe enough flying for today.

928
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
What do you say?

929
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,160
Your neurotransmitter levels are rising steadily.

930
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,650
Which means what?

931
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,290
The treatment is working.

932
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,820
Oh, no!

933
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,410
No, no, no, no, no!

934
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,760
Whoa, Baymax!

935
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,090
Yes!

936
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,290
That was...

937
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,410
That was...

938
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,080
Sick.

939
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,290
It is just an expression.

940
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,540
That's... that's right, buddy.

941
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:21,380
I am never taking the bus again.

942
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,430
Your emotional state has improved.

943
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,470
I can deactivate if you say you are satisfied with your care.

944
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,400
What?

945
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,240
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

946
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,910
We still have to find that guy.

947
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,030
So, fire up that super-sensor.

948
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,210
Functionality improved.

949
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,280
1000% increase in range.

950
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,840
I have found a match,

951
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,970
on that island.

952
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,590
-Killer view. -Yeah. If I...

953
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,760
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

954
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,050
I'd probably love this.

955
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,520
But I'm terrified of heights, so I don't love it.

956
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,240
There. Baymax, take us in.

957
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,820
Awesome!

958
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,280
Our first landing together as a team.

959
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,240
Guys, come on.

960
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,500
"Quarantine"?

961
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,410
Do you people know what "Quarantine" Means?

962
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,480
"Quarantine."

963
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,940
Enforced isolation to prevent contamination

964
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,980
that could lead to disease, or, in some cases, death.

965
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,210
There's a skull face on this one.

966
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,420
A skull face!

967
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,800
Be ready.

968
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,840
He could be anywhere.

969
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,060
Fire!

970
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,360
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

971
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,410
That was a bird.

972
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,950
Well, at least we know our gear works.

973
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,100
Six intrepid friends

974
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,520
Led by Fred

975
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,350
Their leader, Fred

976
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,850
Fred's angels

977
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,430
Fred's angels

978
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,370
Harnessing the power of the sun with the

979
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,190
Ancient amulet they found in the attic

980
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,730
The amulet is green

981
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,210
It's probably an emerald

982
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,660
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.

983
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,290
Guys, Shhhh...

984
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,200
Any sign of him, Baymax?

985
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,420
This structure is interfering with my sensor.

986
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,170
Perfect. The robot's broken.

987
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,640
Guys, you might want to see this.

988
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,010
What do you think it is, genius?

989
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,860
I'm not sure. But look.

990
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,610
Hiro.

991
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,260
Krei.

992
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:57,860
That's right.

993
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,400
We were asked to do the impossible.

994
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
That's what we did.

995
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:06,450
We've reinvented the very concept of transportation.

996
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:11,150
Friends, I present project Silent Sparrow.

997
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,930
General, may I?

998
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,720
Magic hat!

999
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,740
Teleportation.

1000
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,120
The transport of matter instantaneously through space.

1001
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,260
Not science fiction anymore.

1002
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:45,960
Now, we didn't spend billions of tax dollars to teleport hats.

1003
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,860
Ladies and gentlemen, you're here to witness history.

1004
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,300
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?

1005
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,620
We've invited all these people.

1006
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,360
Might as well give 'em a show.

1007
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,850
T-minus 30 seconds to launch.

1008
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,580
-29, 28... -This is argo.

1009
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,420
-Capsule's in position. -27...

1010
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,980
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity

1011
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,810
in the magnetic containment field.

1012
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,210
Mr. Krei, is there a problem?

1013
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,810
No. No problem.

1014
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,420
It's well within the parameters.

1015
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,930
Let's move forward.

1016
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,930
3, 2, 1.

1017
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,610
Cabin pressure is go.

1018
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,640
Pod engaged.

1019
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,780
Field breach! Abort!

1020
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,160
We've lost all contact with the pod.

1021
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,540
Oh, no.

1022
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,550
-It's breaking up! -The pilot is gone.

1023
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,200
Portal two is down.

1024
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,370
The magnetic containment field's down!

1025
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,630
Krei, shut it down now!

1026
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,550
I want this island sealed off!

1027
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,390
The government shut down Krei's experiment.

1028
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,340
And he's using your microbots to steal his machine back.

1029
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,480
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1030
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,350
Oh, no.

1031
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,620
Baymax, get us out of here.

1032
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,990
Go for the transmitter.

1033
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,660
Behind his mask.

1034
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,550
Baymax!

1035
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,660
All right, what's the plan?

1036
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,220
It's Fred time.

1037
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,290
Super jump!

1038
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,970
Gravity crush!

1039
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,500
Falling hard.

1040
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,350
Seriously, what is the plan?

1041
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,890
-Get the mask. -Right behind you.

1042
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,100
For real, what is the plan?

1043
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,010
Hey!

1044
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,900
You want to dance, masked man?

1045
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,780
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.

1046
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,900
Hand over the mask, or you'll get a taste of this!

1047
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,160
And a little bit of that!

1048
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,580
Hey! I did all right.

1049
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,670
Is that all you got?

1050
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,250
You got that, too?

1051
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,420
It's back into the fire!

1052
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,240
It's over, Krei.

1053
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,380
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1054
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,790
The explosion...

1055
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,130
You died.

1056
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,800
No. I had your microbots.

1057
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,800
But, Tadashi.

1058
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,070
You just let him die.

1059
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,480
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1060
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,110
He went in there to save you!

1061
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,650
That was his mistake!

1062
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,790
Baymax, destroy.

1063
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,250
My programing prevents me from injuring a human being.

1064
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,700
Not anymore.

1065
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,630
Hiro, this is not what...

1066
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,510
Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!

1067
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,010
No! Stop, Baymax!

1068
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,900
No, stop! He's getting away!

1069
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,740
Baymax!

1070
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,100
My healthcare protocol has been violated.

1071
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,870
I regret any distress I may have caused.

1072
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,360
How could you do that? I had him!

1073
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,360
What you just did, we never signed up for.

1074
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,710
We said we'd catch the guy.

1075
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:31,950
That's it.

1076
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,080
I never should have let you help me!

1077
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,040
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1078
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,220
My enhanced scanner has been damaged.

1079
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,670
Wings.

1080
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,050
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1081
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,550
Fly!

1082
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,340
Hiro!

1083
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,740
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1084
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,170
You appear to be distressed.

1085
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,870
I'm fine!

1086
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,870
There. Is it working?

1087
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,800
- My sensor is operational. - Good.

1088
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,590
Then let's get...

1089
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,290
What?

1090
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,600
Are you going to remove my healthcare chip?

1091
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,420
Yes. Open!

1092
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,510
My purpose is to heal the sick and injured.

1093
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,680
Baymax, open your access port.

1094
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,470
Do you want me to terminate Professor Callaghan?

1095
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,610
Just open!

1096
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,670
Will terminating Professor Callaghan

1097
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,520
improve your emotional state?

1098
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,910
Yes! No! I don't know!

1099
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,150
Open your access!

1100
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,660
- Is this what Tadashi wanted? - It doesn't matter!

1101
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,080
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1102
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,460
Tadashi's gone!

1103
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,380
Tadashi's gone.

1104
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,510
Tadashi is here.

1105
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,050
No. He's not here.

1106
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,090
Tadashi is here.

1107
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,090
This is Tadashi Hamada.

1108
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,940
And this is the first test of my robotics project.

1109
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,440
Hello, I am Baymax.

1110
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,240
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1111
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,370
The seventh test of my robotics project.

1112
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,790
Hello, I...

1113
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,120
What? What?

1114
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,410
Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop scan! Stop...

1115
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,990
Tadashi Hamada again,

1116
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:43,420
and this is the 33rd test of my robotics project.

1117
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,100
I'm not giving up on you.

1118
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,880
You don't understand this yet, but people need you.

1119
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,730
So, let's get back to work.

1120
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,010
This is Tadashi Hamada,

1121
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,650
and this is the 84th test.

1122
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,450
What do you say, big guy?

1123
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,070
Hello, I am Baymax,

1124
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,160
your personal healthcare companion.

1125
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,440
It works.

1126
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,830
It works!

1127
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:17,500
This is amazing! You... you work!

1128
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,090
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.

1129
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,370
I knew it. Oh, you work. I can't believe it! I can't...

1130
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,010
Okay. All right, big moment, here.

1131
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,390
Scan me.

1132
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:32,310
Your neurotransmitter levels are elevated.

1133
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,590
This indicates that you are happy.

1134
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:37,140
I am. I really am.

1135
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,180
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.

1136
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,100
You're gonna help so many people, buddy.

1137
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,850
So many.

1138
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,730
That's all for now. I am satisfied with my care.

1139
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,790
Thank you, Baymax.

1140
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,840
I'm so sorry.

1141
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,540
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1142
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,550
Hiro.

1143
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,060
Guys, I, I...

1144
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,980
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1145
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,360
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1146
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,290
But maybe don't leave your team

1147
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,240
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1148
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,240
- Oh, man. - Nah, it's cool.

1149
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,460
Heathcliff picked us up in the family chopper.

1150
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,410
Hiro, we found something you should see.

1151
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,750
You almost got us all killed!

1152
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,090
Krei! You did this!

1153
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,040
You knew it wasn't ready!

1154
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,970
Callaghan? He was there?

1155
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,270
He was such a good man. What happened?

1156
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,730
I don't know.

1157
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,690
But the answer's here somewhere.

1158
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,350
Wait, wait! Stop.

1159
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,140
There he is.

1160
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
With the pilot.

1161
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:11,400
Hang on.

1162
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,480
We've invited all these people...

1164
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,740
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1165
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,950
Callaghan blames Krei.

1166
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,570
This is a revenge story.

1167
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,670
So, what are we waiting for?

1168
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,670
It's all set up.

1169
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:38,340
This beautiful new campus is the culmination of a lifelong dream.

1170
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:41,130
But none of this would've been possible

1171
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,600
without a few bumps in the road.

1172
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:47,670
Those setbacks made us stronger,

1174
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,530
and set us on the path to a bright future.

1175
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,110
What is that?

1176
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,600
- What? - Setback?

1177
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,490
Was my daughter a "Setback"?

1178
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,920
Callaghan! But you...

1179
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,010
Your daughter, that...

1180
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,500
That was an accident.

1181
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,540
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1182
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,270
My daughter is gone because of your arrogance.

1183
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,140
What are you doing?

1184
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,140
You took everything from me

1185
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,450
when you sent Abigail into that machine.

1186
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,250
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1187
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,580
No!

1188
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,330
No! No! You can't!

1189
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,060
You're going to watch everything you've built disappear.

1190
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,810
Then, it's your turn.

1191
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,670
Professor Callaghan!

1192
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,320
Let him go!

1193
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,280
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1194
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,190
Abigail is gone!

1195
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,530
This won't change anything. Trust me, I know.

1196
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,400
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1197
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,620
Please, let me go.

1198
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,790
I'll give you anything you want!

1199
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,420
I want my daughter back!

1200
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,290
Go for the mask!

1201
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,570
Baymax!

1202
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,230
Leaping into action!

1203
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,680
Oh, no!

1204
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,510
Getting a little... A little tight.

1205
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,780
- No! - He's too strong!

1206
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,130
- There's no way out! - You can't beat him!

1207
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,620
Help! I can't beat him.

1208
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,050
Hiro!

1209
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,470
- Hiro? Hiro? - Help!

1210
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,180
- That's it! - Hiro.

1211
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,590
- I know how to beat him. - Hiro.

1212
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,640
Listen up!

1213
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,050
Use those big brains of yours,

1214
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,600
and think your way around the problem.

1215
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,170
Look for a new angle.

1216
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,230
My arms! They can't go any further!

1217
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,750
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1218
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,620
Hello, sign.

1219
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,120
Care to go for a little spin?

1220
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,750
Double spin!

1221
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:36,910
Behind-the-back spin!

1222
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,770
Baymax!

1223
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,780
Hiro.

1224
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,130
I love that robot!

1225
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,130
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.

1226
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,560
Take out the bots. They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1227
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,230
Now that is a plan!

1228
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,430
Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover?

1229
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,400
Like you have to ask.

1230
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,640
Let's do this, Freddie!

1231
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,610
Smokescreen!

1232
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,150
Ready and

1233
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,250
dive!

1234
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,210
Whoa, the gravity's getting a little weird here, guys!

1235
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,760
Wait. Let's use this!

1236
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,850
These are green blades of fury!

1237
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,800
Woman up!

1238
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,890
Double sign-spin.

1239
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,280
Now my signs are on fire!

1240
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,630
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1241
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:45,220
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1242
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,750
Hammerfist.

1243
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,380
This ends now!

1244
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,070
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1245
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,310
What?

1246
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,410
Baymax!

1247
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,240
No!

1248
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,210
Our programing prevents us from injuring a human being.

1249
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,800
But we'll take that.

1250
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,540
It's still on! We have to shut it down!

1251
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,000
We can't! The containment field is failing.

1252
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,420
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1253
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,290
We need to get out of here, now!

1254
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,970
Baymax!

1255
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,350
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1256
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,380
- What? - Coming from there.

1257
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,310
The life signs are female.

1258
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,730
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1259
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,070
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.

1260
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,610
Abigail.

1261
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,440
Let's go get her.

1262
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,320
The portal is destabilizing. You'll never make it.

1263
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:36,490
She's alive in there.

1264
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,370
Someone has to help.

1265
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,280
What do you say, buddy?

1266
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,160
Flying makes me a better healthcare companion.

1267
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,940
Careful! There's Krei tech debris everywhere.

1268
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,120
Look out!

1269
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,430
I have located the patient.

1270
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,680
Hurry!

1271
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,920
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1272
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,540
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1273
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,090
Veer right!

1274
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,020
Okay, to the left.

1275
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,230
Hard right!

1276
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,680
Up and over.

1277
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,270
Okay, level off. Easy.

1278
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,440
Nice flying!

1279
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,360
Almost there!

1280
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,630
Baymax!

1281
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:00,220
Baymax!

1282
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,300
My thrusters are inoperable.

1283
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,430
Just grab hold.

1284
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:24,400
There is still a way I can get you both to safety.

1285
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,330
I cannot deactivate until you say

1286
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,450
you are satisfied with your care.

1287
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,950
No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you?

1288
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,830
- You are my patient. - Baymax.

1289
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,420
Your health is my only concern.

1290
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,170
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1291
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,920
Are you satisfied with your care?

1292
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,850
No. There's gotta be another way.

1293
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,970
I'm not gonna leave you here. I'll think of something.

1294
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,520
There is no time.

1295
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,430
Are you satisfied with your care?

1296
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,140
Please! No.

1297
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,320
I can't lose you, too.

1298
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,780
Hiro, I will always be with you.

1299
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,890
I'm satisfied with my care.

1300
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,930
Hiro!

1301
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,100
Yeah! They made it!

1302
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,060
Baymax?

1303
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:31,750
Miss, can you hear me?

1304
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,460
What is your name?

1305
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,570
Abigail Callaghan.

1306
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,380
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.

1307
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,800
We're taking you to the hospital.

1308
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,040
Move it!

1309
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,550
Get in there.

1310
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,150
A massive cleanup continues today

1311
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,320
at the headquarters of Krei Tech Industries.

1313
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:06,730
Reports are still flooding in

1314
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,830
about a group of unidentified individuals,

1315
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,110
who prevented what could have been a major catastrophe.

1316
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,820
The whole city of San Fransokyo is asking,

1317
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,320
"Who are these heroes? And where are they now?"

1318
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,080
It's so exciting.

1319
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:22,510
Hey, sweetie!

1320
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,760
Okay.

1321
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,340
Last hug.

1322
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:31,680
Bye!

1323
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,340
- And just then I was like... - Get out of here.

1324
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,720
I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.

1325
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,530
Hello, Hiro.

1326
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,700
We didn't set out to be superheroes,

1327
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:43,080
but sometimes life doesn't go the way you planned.

1328
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,260
The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people,

1329
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,000
and that's what we're gonna do.

1330
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,720
Who are we?

1334
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:26,440
Dad, I just wish I could share my accomplishments with you.

1335
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:28,450
You mean so much to me, and honestly,

1336
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,940
I've always felt a distance

1337
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:33,360
what with you being on the family island all the time,

1338
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,730
and I just wish you could see how...

1339
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,130
Fred.

1340
01:40:58,970 --> 01:40:59,970
Son.

1341
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:01,940
Dad?

1342
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:08,310
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.

1343
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:13,620
I go inside out, then I go front and back.

1344
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:14,990
Dad!

1345
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,290
We have a lot to talk about.

2
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,980
Get up! Get up!

3
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,460
The winner,

4
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,720
by total annihilation,

5
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,680
Yama!

6
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,020
Who is next?

7
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Who has the guts to step into the ring with little Yama?

8
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,180
Yama!

9
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,730
Can I try?

10
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,150
I have a robot. I built it myself.

11
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,120
Beat it, kid.

12
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,040
House rules. You gotta pay to play.

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,500
Is this enough?

14
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,540
What's your name, little boy?

15
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,340
Hiro. Hiro Hamada.

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,090
Prepare your bot, zero.

17
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,560
Two bots enter,

18
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,860
one bot leaves.

19
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,990
Fighters ready?

20
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,270
Fight!

21
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,340
That was my first fight. I... Can I try again?

22
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,370
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

23
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,250
Go home.

24
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,870
I've got more money.

25
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,340
Fighters ready?

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,980
Fight!

27
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,260
Mega-bot, destroy.

28
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,820
What?

29
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,630
- No more little Yama. - But, wha...

30
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,420
This is not possible!

31
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,230
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

32
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,800
Beginner's luck.

33
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,310
Do you want to go again, Yama?

34
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,280
No one hustles Yama!

35
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,860
Teach him a lesson.

36
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,980
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.

37
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,950
- Hiro! Get on! - Tadashi!

38
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,620
Good timing!

39
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,830
Oh, mama!

40
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,540
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,890
- Are you hurt? - No.

42
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,010
Then what were you thinking, knucklehead?

43
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,770
You graduated high school when you were 13,

44
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,890
and this is what you're doing?

45
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
There they are!

46
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,530
Hold on!

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,770
Yes!

48
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,310
Get back here.

49
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,440
Bot fighting is illegal.

50
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,240
You're going to get yourself arrested.

51
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Bot fighting is not illegal.

52
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,910
Betting on bot fighting, that's... that's illegal.

53
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,170
But so lucrative!

54
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,630
I'm on a roll, big brother! And there is no stopping me!

55
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Oh, no.

57
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,980
Hi, Aunt Cass.

58
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,050
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.

59
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,610
- We're fine. - We're okay.

60
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,930
Oh, good.

61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,030
Then what were you two knuckleheads thinking?

62
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
For 10 years,

63
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,660
I have done the best I could to raise you.

64
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,520
Have I been perfect? No.

65
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,580
Do I know anything about children? No.

66
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,490
Should I have picked up a book on parenting?

67
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,830
Probably!

68
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,120
Where was I going with this? I had a point.

69
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,380
- Sorry. - We love you, Aunt Cass.

70
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,910
Well, I love you, too!

71
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,010
I had to close up early because of you two felons.

72
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,290
On beat poetry night.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,090
Stress eating. Because of you.

74
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,340
Come on, Mochi.

75
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,470
This is really good!

76
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,820
You better make this up to Aunt Cass

77
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,340
before she eats everything in the cafe.

78
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,640
For sure.

79
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,940
And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.

80
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,970
Absolutely.

81
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,860
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

82
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,320
There's a fight across town. If I book, I can still make it.

83
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,730
When are you gonna

84
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,780
start doing something with that big brain of yours?

85
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,700
What? Go to college like you?

86
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,580
So people can tell me stuff I already know?

87
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,420
Unbelievable.

88
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,030
What would mom and dad say?

89
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,300
I don't know.

90
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,010
They're gone.

91
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,380
They died when I was three, remember?

92
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,130
- I'll take you. - Really?

93
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,420
I can't stop you from going,

94
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,880
but I'm not going to let you go on your own.

95
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,190
Sweet.

97
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,860
What are we doing at your nerd school?

98
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,560
Bot-fight's that way!

100
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,110
Gotta grab something.

101
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,810
Is this gonna take long?

102
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,280
Relax, you big baby. We'll be in and out.

103
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,910
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,750
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

105
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,990
Heads up!

106
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,640
Electro-mag suspension?

107
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,270
- Who are you? - I'm...

108
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,350
Go go, this is my brother Hiro.

109
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,990
Welcome to the nerd lab.

110
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Yeah.

111
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,660
I've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.

112
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,330
Zero resistance, faster bike.

113
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,160
But, not fast enough,

114
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,710
yet.

115
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,170
Do not move. Behind the line, please.

116
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,970
Hey, Wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.

117
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,560
Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.

118
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,630
Catch.

119
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,610
- Laser-induced plasma? - Oh, yeah.

120
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,610
With a little magnetic confinement for ultra-precision.

121
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,820
Wow. How do you find anything in this mess?

122
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,820
I have a system.

123
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,950
There's a place for everything,

124
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,900
and everything in its place.

125
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,410
- Need this! - You can't do that!

126
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,610
This is anarchy! Society has rules!

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,460
Excuse me!

128
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,070
Coming through!

129
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,740
Tadashi!

130
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,870
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

131
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I've heard so much about you!

132
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,290
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

133
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,890
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

134
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,630
400 pounds of it!

135
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,960
Come here, come here, come here.

136
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,760
You're going to love this.

137
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,050
A dash of perchloric acid, a smidge of cobalt,

138
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,730
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

139
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,350
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...

140
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,810
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

141
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,360
It's so pink.

142
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,280
Here's the best part.

143
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,040
I know, right?

144
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,410
Chemical metal embrittlement.

145
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,050
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

146
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,830
"Honey Lemon"? "Go go"? "Wasabi"?

147
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,050
I spill wasabi on my shirt one time, people.

148
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,510
One time!

149
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,810
Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.

150
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,350
Who's Fred?

151
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,930
This guy, right here!

152
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,650
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,190
This is not my real face and body.

154
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,470
The name's Fred.

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,520
School mascot by day, but by night,

156
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,650
I am also a school mascot.

157
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,200
So, what's your major?

158
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,740
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

159
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,910
But I am a major science enthusiast.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,120
I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula,

161
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,250
that can turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will.

162
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,660
But she says that's "Not science."

163
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,910
It's really not.

164
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,630
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

165
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,590
I asked Wasabi for isn't "Science" either.

166
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,790
- Is it? - Nope.

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,630
Well, then, what about "Invisible sandwich"?

168
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,840
- Hiro. - Imagine eating a sandwich,

169
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,920
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

170
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,050
Just stop.

171
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,340
- Laser eyes? - What?

172
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,220
- Tingly fingers? - Never gonna happen.

173
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,470
Hey, what about a growth serum?

174
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,610
So, what have you been working on?

175
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,930
I'll show you.

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,060
Duct tape?

177
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,020
I hate to break it to you, bro.

178
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,310
Already been invented.

179
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,870
Dude!

180
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Ow!

181
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,170
This is what I've been working on.

182
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
Hello. I am Baymax.

183
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,240
Your personal healthcare companion.

184
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,700
I was alerted to the need

185
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,160
for medical attention when you said, "Ow."

186
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,440
A robotic nurse.

187
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,490
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

188
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,490
Physical or emotional?

189
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,790
I will scan you now.

190
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,160
Scan complete.

191
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,880
You have a slight epidermal abrasion on your forearm.

192
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,590
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

193
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,260
What's in the spray, specifically?

194
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,350
The primary ingredient is Bacitracin.

195
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,020
That's a bummer. I'm actually allergic to that.

196
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,110
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

197
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,650
You do have a mild allergy to peanuts.

198
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,350
Not bad.

199
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,030
You've done some serious coding on this thing, huh?

200
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,150
Programed him with over 10,000 medical procedures.

202
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,830
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.

203
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,670
Vinyl?

204
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,960
Yeah, going for a non-threatening, huggable kind of thing.

205
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,170
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

206
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,800
- No offense. - I am a robot.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,210
I cannot be offended.

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,390
- Hyperspectral cameras? -Yep.

209
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,100
- Titanium skeleton? - Carbon fiber.

210
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,440
Right. Even lighter.

211
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,890
Killer actuators. Where did you get those?

212
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,640
Machined them right here, in-house.

213
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,030
- Really? - Yup.

214
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,690
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

215
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Shut up.

216
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,520
You have been a good boy. Have a lollipop.

217
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,870
Nice.

218
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,090
I cannot deactivate until you say

219
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,450
you are satisfied with your care.

220
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,450
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

221
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,580
He's going to help a lot of people.

222
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,700
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

223
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Lithium ion.

224
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,720
You know, supercapacitors would charge way faster.

225
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,960
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?

226
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,050
Hey, Professor.

227
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,090
Actually, I was just finishing up.

228
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,390
You must be Hiro.

229
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,050
Bot-fighter, right?

230
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,900
When my daughter was younger, that's all she wanted to do.

231
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,140
May I?

232
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,600
Sure.

233
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,070
Magnetic-bearing servos.

234
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,450
Pretty sick, huh?

235
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,770
Wanna see how I put 'em together?

236
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,330
Hey, genius!

237
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,280
He invented them.

238
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,740
You're Robert Callaghan?

239
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,570
Like, as in,

240
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,450
the Callaghan-catmull spline,

241
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,080
and Callaghan's "Laws of robotics"?

242
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,290
That's right.

243
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,120
Ever think about applying here?

244
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,670
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

245
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I don't know.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,250
He's pretty serious about his career in bot-fighting.

247
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,750
Well, kind of serious.

248
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,970
I can see why.

249
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,090
With your bot, winning must come easy.

250
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,010
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,200
Well, if you like things easy,

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,520
then my program isn't for you.

253
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,020
We push the boundaries of robotics here.

254
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,650
My students go on to shape the future.

255
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,450
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

256
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,030
Good luck with the bot-fights.

257
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,950
We gotta hurry if you want to catch that bot-fight.

258
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,750
I have to go here.

259
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,460
If I don't go to this nerd school,

260
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,830
I'm gonna lose my mind.

261
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
How do I get in?

263
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,220
Every year, the school has a student showcase.

264
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,200
You come up with something that blows Callaghan away,

265
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,930
you're in.

266
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,720
But, it's gotta be great.

268
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,140
Trust me.

269
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,300
It will be.

270
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,730
Nothing!

271
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,990
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!

272
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,330
Wow. Washed up at 14.

273
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,450
So sad.

274
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,330
I got nothing! I'm done. I'm never getting in.

275
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,340
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.

276
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,380
What are you doing?

277
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,840
Shake things up.

278
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,340
Use that big brain of yours to think your way out.

279
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,510
- What? - Look for a new angle.

280
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,210
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.

281
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,550
How are you feeling?

282
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,380
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.

283
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,230
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

284
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,440
Yep, he's nervous.

285
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,890
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

286
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,730
- He's so tense. - No, I'm not.

287
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,400
Relax, Hiro.

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,310
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go go.

289
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,040
Stop whining. Woman up.

290
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm fine!

291
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,560
What do you need, little man? Deodorant? Breath mint?

292
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Fresh pair of underpants?

293
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,790
Underpants? You need serious help.

294
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey, I come prepared.

295
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,110
I haven't done laundry in six months.

296
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,420
One pair lasts me four days.

297
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,570
I go front, I go back,

298
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,740
I go inside-out. Then I go front and back.

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,170
Wow. That is both disgusting and awesome.

300
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,510
Don't encourage him.

301
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,080
It's called "Recycling."

302
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,850
Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.

303
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,800
Oh, yeah. This is it.

304
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,970
I guess I'm up.

305
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,260
Okay, photo, photo! Everybody say, "Hiro."

306
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,840
- Hiro! - Yeah!

307
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,600
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

308
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,190
- Don't mess it up. - Break a leg, little man.

309
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,820
Science, yeah!

310
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,100
All right, bro. This is it.

311
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,700
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

312
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,780
What's going on?

313
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,330
I really want to go here.

314
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
You got this.

315
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,290
My name is Hiro...

316
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,930
Sorry.

317
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,770
My name is Hiro Hamada,

318
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,310
and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool.

319
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,310
I hope you like it.

320
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,150
This is a microbot.

321
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,460
Breathe.

322
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,660
It doesn't look like much,

323
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,040
but when it links up with the rest of its pals,

324
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,510
things get a little more interesting.

325
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,910
The microbots are controlled with this neural transmitter.

326
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,530
I think what I want them to do...

327
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,580
They do it.

328
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,870
The applications for this tech are limitless.

329
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,510
Construction.

330
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,340
What used to take teams of people working by hand

331
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,760
for months or years,

332
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,560
can now be accomplished by one person.

333
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,050
And that's just the beginning.

334
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,760
How about transportation?

335
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,390
Microbots can move anything anywhere,

336
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,200
with ease.

337
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,580
If you can think it, the microbots can do it.

338
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
The only limit is your imagination.

339
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,930
Microbots!

340
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,390
That's my nephew!

341
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,690
Yes!

342
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,480
My family! I love my family!

343
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,270
Nailed it!

344
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,270
- You did it! - Not bad!

345
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,280
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!

346
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,770
They loved you. That was amazing!

347
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,280
Yes.

348
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,580
With some development, your tech could be revolutionary.

349
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,820
Alistair Krei!

350
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,460
May I?

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,130
Extraordinary.

352
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,470
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

353
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,170
Shut up.

354
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,830
Mr. Krei is right.

355
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,840
Your microbots are an inspired piece of tech.

356
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,630
You can continue to develop them,

357
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,310
or you can sell them to a man

358
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,520
who's only guided by his own self-interest.

359
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,440
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

360
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,680
but it shouldn't affect...

361
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,470
This is your decision, Hiro.

362
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,690
But you should know

363
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,650
Mr. Krei has cut corners and ignored sound science

364
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
to get where he is.

365
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,150
That's just not true.

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,060
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech

367
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,870
with your microbots,

368
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,500
or anything else.

369
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,420
Hiro, I'm offering you

370
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,030
more money than any 14-year-old could imagine.

371
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,060
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,

372
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,460
but they're not for sale.

373
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,390
I thought you were smarter than that.

374
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,960
Robert.

375
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,060
Mr. Krei.

376
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,390
That's my brother's.

377
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,860
That's right.

378
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,200
I look forward to seeing you in class.

379
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,870
Unbelievable!

380
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,150
That's what I'm talking about.

381
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,960
All right, geniuses,

382
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,370
let's feed those hungry brains.

383
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Back to the cafe!

384
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,880
Dinner is on me!

385
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,880
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

386
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,870
- Aunt Cass? - Unless it's moldy.

387
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,370
We'll... we'll catch up, okay?

388
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,720
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

389
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,590
Both of you.

390
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,930
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

391
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,270
I know what you're going to say.

392
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,190
"I should be proud of myself,"

393
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,110
"because I'm finally using my gift for something important."

394
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,270
No, no. I was just gonna

395
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,030
tell you your fly was down for the whole show.

396
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,110
Ha-ha-hilarious.

397
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,080
What?

398
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,130
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

399
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,450
Hey, I...

400
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,430
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. So,

401
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,430
you know,

402
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,430
thanks for not giving up on me.

403
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,100
Are you okay?

404
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,780
Yeah. I'm okay.

405
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,570
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.

406
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,440
Tadashi, no!

407
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,420
Callaghan's in there.

408
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,790
Someone has to help.

409
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,810
Tadashi!

410
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,480
Tadashi!

411
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,040
Here. Have some tea.

412
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,240
Hey, sweetie.

413
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,690
Hey, Aunt Cass.

414
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,620
Mrs. Matsuda's in the cafe.

415
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,080
She's wearing something super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.

416
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,410
That always cracks you up.

417
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,580
You should come down.

418
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,960
Maybe later.

419
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,050
The university called again.

420
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,290
It's been a few weeks since classes started.

421
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,710
But they said it's not too late to register.

422
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,470
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.

424
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,950
Hey, Hiro.

425
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,820
We just wanted to check in, and see how you're doing.

426
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,090
We wish you were here, buddy.

427
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,120
Hiro, if I could have only one superpower right now,

428
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,670
it would be the ability to crawl through this camera,

429
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,130
and give you a big hug.

430
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Ow!

431
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,060
Hello. I am Baymax,

432
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,020
your personal healthcare companion.

433
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,020
Hey, Baymax.

434
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,860
I didn't know you were still active.

435
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,030
I heard a sound of distress.

436
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,650
What seems to be the trouble?

437
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,750
I just stubbed my toe a little.

438
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm fine.

439
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,200
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

440
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,210
A zero. I'm okay, really.

441
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,290
Thanks. You can shrink now.

442
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,970
Does it hurt when I touch it?

443
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,930
That's okay. No touching.

444
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,590
I'm fine...

445
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,050
You have fallen.

446
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,230
You think?

447
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,740
- On a scale of 1 to... - Ow!

448
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,100
On a scale...

449
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,270
On a sca...

450
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,620
On a scale of 1 to 10...

451
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,280
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

452
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,080
Zero.

453
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,450
- It is all right to cry. - No. No, no, no, no.

454
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,240
Crying is a natural response to pain.

455
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,410
I'm not crying.

456
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,910
- I will scan you for injuries. - Don't scan me.

457
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,750
- Scan complete. - Unbelievable.

458
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,760
You have sustained no injuries.

459
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,420
However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels

460
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,420
indicate that you are experiencing mood swings,

461
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,800
common in adolescence.

462
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,420
Diagnosis, puberty.

463
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,770
What?

464
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,350
Okay. Time to shrink now.

465
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,470
You should expect an increase in body hair,

466
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,110
especially on your face, chest, armpits, and...

467
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,490
Thank you! That's enough.

468
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,270
You may also experience strange and powerful new urges.

469
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,280
Okay! Let's get you back in your luggage.

470
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,510
I cannot deactivate until you say

471
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,450
you are satisfied with your care.

472
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,120
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

473
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,470
My microbot?

474
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,960
This doesn't make any sense.

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,430
Puberty can often be a confusing time

476
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,650
for a young adolescent flowering into manhood.

477
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,640
No. The thing is attracted to the other microbots,

478
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,640
but that's impossible.

479
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,810
They were destroyed in the fire.

480
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,990
Dumb thing's broken.

481
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,160
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

482
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,340
Oh, yeah?

483
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,010
Why don't you find out where it's trying to go?

484
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,660
Would that stabilize your pubescent mood swings?

485
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,220
Absolutely.

486
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,180
Baymax?

487
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,350
Baymax?

488
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,650
Baymax?

489
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,410
What?

490
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,540
- Hiro? - Hey, Aunt Cass!

491
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,910
Wow. You're up and...

492
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,870
Yeah! I figured it was time.

493
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,910
Are you registering for school?

494
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Yes.

495
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,950
I thought about what you said. Really inspired me.

496
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,380
Oh, honey, that's so great.

497
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,880
Okay,

498
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,300
special dinner tonight.

499
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,800
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

500
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,390
You know, with the hot sauce that makes our faces numb.

501
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,220
- Okay, sounds good. - Great!

502
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,890
Last hug.

503
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,070
Baymax!

504
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,240
Baymax!

505
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Watch it!

506
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,810
Baymax!

507
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,280
Baymax!

508
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,110
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

509
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,860
I have found where your tiny robot wants to go.

510
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,460
I told you, it's broken. It's not trying to go...

511
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,670
Locked.

512
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,890
There is a window.

513
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,840
Please exercise caution.

514
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,400
A fall from this height could lead to bodily harm.

515
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,380
Oh, no.

516
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,380
Excuse me while I let out some air.

517
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
Are you done?

518
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,350
Yes.

519
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,110
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

520
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,680
Fine, just keep it down.

521
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,570
My microbots?

522
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,120
Someone's making more.

523
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,340
Hiro?

524
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,750
You gave me a heart attack!

525
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,090
My hands are equipped with defibrillators. Clear.

526
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,920
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression.

527
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,300
Oh, no.

528
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,640
Run!

529
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,810
Oh, come on!

530
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,310
I am not fast.

531
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,940
Yeah, no kidding!

532
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,610
Go! Go! Come on.

533
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,030
Kick it down!

534
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,950
Then punch it!

535
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,130
Go! Go!

536
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,500
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

537
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Move it!

538
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,800
Come on!

539
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,320
No, no.

540
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,410
Come on! The window!

541
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,490
Suck it in!

542
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,340
Baymax!

543
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,000
Hiro?

544
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,100
Come on, let's get out of here.

545
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,020
Go! Hurry!

546
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,100
All right, let me get this straight.

547
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,200
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

548
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,520
with an army of miniature flying robots.

549
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,190
"Microbots."

550
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,370
-Microbots. -Yeah.

551
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,910
He was controlling them

552
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,280
telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter.

553
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,210
So, Mr. Kabuki was using esp

554
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,050
to attack you and balloon man.

555
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,820
Did you file a report when your flying robots were stolen?

556
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,090
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

557
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,620
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

558
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,330
but Baymax was there, too.

559
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,470
-Tell him. -Yes, officer.

560
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,420
He's telling the truth.

561
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,760
What the... What's wrong with you?

562
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,600
Low battery.

563
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,430
Try to keep it together.

564
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,610
I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion.

565
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,300
Kid, how about we call your parents,

566
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,610
and get them down here?

567
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,940
What?

568
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,690
Write your name and number down

569
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,290
on this piece of paper, and we can...

570
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,130
I've gotta get you home to your charging station.

571
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Can you walk?

572
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,120
I will scan you now. Scan complete.

573
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,680
Healthcare.

574
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Okay.

575
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,390
If my aunt asks, we were at school all day. Got it?

576
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,890
We jumped out a window.

577
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,780
No! Quiet!

578
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,660
We jumped out a window.

579
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,980
You can't say things like that around aunt Cass.

580
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,340
Hiro?

581
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,660
You home, sweetie?

582
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,680
That's right.

583
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,380
I thought I heard you.

584
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,670
Hey, aunt Cass.

585
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,010
Look at my little college man.

586
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,230
I can't wait to hear all about it!

587
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,510
And wings are almost ready.

588
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Whee!

589
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Will you be quiet?

590
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,680
Yeah, wings! Whee!

591
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,570
All right, get ready to have your face melted.

592
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,690
We are gonna feel these things tomorrow.

593
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,190
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Okay.

595
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,870
Sit down. Tell me everything.

596
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,630
The thing is that, since I registered so late,

597
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,120
I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.

598
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,580
What was that?

599
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,380
Mochi.

600
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,890
That darn cat.

601
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,560
At least take a plate for the road, okay?

602
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,890
-Don't work too... -Thanks for understanding.

603
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:39,060
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

604
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,360
All right, come on.

605
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm healthcare, your personal baymax companion.

606
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,690
One foot in front of the other.

607
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,680
This doesn't make any sense.

608
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,210
Tadashi.

609
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,340
What?

610
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,020
Tadashi.

611
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,980
Tadashi's gone.

612
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,400
When will he return?

613
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,820
He's dead, baymax.

614
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,660
Tadashi was in excellent health.

615
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,900
With a proper diet and exercise,

616
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,960
he should have lived a long life.

617
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,910
Yeah, he should have.

618
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,380
But there was a fire and...

619
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,540
Now, he's gone.

620
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,050
-Tadashi is here. -No.

621
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,680
People keep saying he's not really gone.

622
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,140
As long as we remember him.

623
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,640
It still hurts.

624
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,640
I see no evidence of physical injury.

625
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,570
It's a different kind of hurt.

626
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,870
You are my patient.

627
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,310
I would like to help.

628
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,480
You can't fix this one, buddy.

629
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,410
What are you doing?

630
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,740
I am downloading a database on personal loss.

631
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,450
Database downloaded.

632
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,050
Treatments include contact with friends and loved ones.

637
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,500
I am contacting them now.

638
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,170
No, no, no! I... Don't do that.

639
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,630
Your friends have been contacted.

640
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
Unbelievable.

641
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,430
Now, what are you doing?

642
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,390
Other treatments include compassion and physical reassurance.

643
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,900
I'm okay. Really.

644
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,140
You will be all right. There, there.

645
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,820
Thanks, Baymax.

646
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,450
I am sorry about the fire.

647
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,570
It's okay. It was an accident.

648
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,870
Unless...

649
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,210
Unless it wasn't.

650
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,700
At the showcase,

651
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,380
that guy in the mask stole my microbots. And...

652
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,090
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.

653
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,170
He's responsible for Tadashi.

654
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,600
We gotta catch that guy.

655
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,840
It's alive!

656
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,440
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!

657
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,810
If we're gonna catch that guy,

658
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,610
you need some upgrades.

659
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,770
Will apprehending the man

660
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,360
in the mask improve your emotional state?

661
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,190
Absolutely.

662
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,000
Let's work on your moves.

663
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,090
Now, let's take care of this.

664
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,040
I have some concerns.

665
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,060
This armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.

666
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,960
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

668
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,890
You look sick.

669
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,270
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

670
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,010
It's just an expression.

671
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,270
Data transfer complete.

673
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,330
I fail to see

674
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,920
how karate makes me a better healthcare companion.

675
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,590
You want to keep me healthy, don't you?

676
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,960
Punch this.

677
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,840
Yes! Hammerfist!

678
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,600
Side kick!

679
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,970
Knifehand!

680
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,610
Back kick!

681
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,690
Gummy bears!

682
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,120
Yes!

683
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,330
Yeah! Fist bump!

684
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,220
"Fist bump" Is not in my fighting database.

685
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,800
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

686
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,140
It's what people do sometimes

687
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,930
when they're excited or pumped up.

688
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,060
Hey, now you're getting it.

689
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,780
I will add "Fist bump" to my care-giving matrix.

690
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,280
All right. Let's go get that guy.

691
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,370
Come on!

692
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,350
Get him, Baymax!

693
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,780
We're too late.

694
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,520
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

695
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,450
Come on.

696
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,880
Always wait one hour after eating before swimming.

697
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,400
Come on!

698
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,320
Your heart rate has increased dramatic...

699
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,050
Okay, Baymax, time to use those upgrades.

700
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,440
-Hiro? -No, no, no!

701
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,890
Get out of here! Go!

702
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,640
Dude, what are you doing out here?

703
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,270
Nothing! Just out for a walk.

704
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,100
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

705
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,410
Is that Baymax?

706
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,150
Yeah, but you really...

707
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,940
Why is he wearing carbon fiber underpants?

708
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,750
I also know karate.

709
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,030
You guys need to go.

710
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,890
No, don't push us away, Hiro.

711
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,080
We're here for you.

712
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,750
That's why Baymax contacted us.

713
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,250
Those who suffer a loss,

714
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,670
require support from friends and loved ones.

715
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,870
Okay, but I...

716
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,800
Who would like to share their feelings first?

717
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,460
I'll go. Okay.

718
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,130
My name is Fred, and it has been 30 days since my last...

719
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,000
Holy mother of megazon!

720
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,930
Am I the only one seeing this?

721
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,220
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

722
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,060
Go!

723
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,610
Baymax, get him!

724
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,080
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

725
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,530
I'm saving your life.

726
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,900
Baymax can handle that guy!

727
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,490
Oh, no.

728
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,420
Wasabi!

729
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,130
Goodbye!

730
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,050
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

731
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,890
He stole my microbots. He started the fire.

732
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,510
I don't know who he is!

733
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,260
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

734
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,430
Hard left!

735
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,000
That mask, the black suit...

736
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,340
We're under attack from a super villain, people!

737
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,080
I mean, how cool is that?

738
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,370
I mean, it's scary, obviously. But how cool!

739
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,970
Why are we stopped?

740
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,010
The light's red!

741
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,640
There are no red lights in a car chase!

742
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,590
Why is he trying to kill us?

743
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,970
Why are you trying to kill us?

744
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,940
It's classic villain. We've seen too much!

745
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,320
Let's not jump to conclusions.

746
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,310
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

747
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,610
Car!

748
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,940
He's trying to kill us!

749
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,320
Did you just put your blinker on?

750
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,900
You have to indicate your turn!

751
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,190
It's the law!

752
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,250
That's it.

753
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,990
Stop the car!

754
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,320
Baymax and I can take this guy!

755
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,660
Seatbelts save lives.

756
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,290
Buckle up, every time.

757
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,000
What are you doing? What are you doing?

758
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,140
What are you doing? What are you doing?

759
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,850
-Did we lose him? -Look out!

760
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,440
Baymax, hold on!

761
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,040
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

762
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,400
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

763
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,240
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

764
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,250
We made it! Yes!

765
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,780
I told you we'd make it!

766
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
Your injuries require my attention.

767
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,250
And your body temperatures are low.

768
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,960
We should get out of here.

769
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,010
I know a place.

770
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,040
Where are we?

771
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,880
Fred.

772
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,350
Where are you going?

773
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,510
Welcome to mi casa.

775
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,360
That's French for "Front door."

776
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,180
It's really not.

777
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,530
Listen, nitwit.

778
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,190
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

779
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,810
I'm not in the mood for any...

780
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,480
Welcome home, master Frederick.

781
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,370
Heathcliff, my man!

782
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,820
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.

783
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,120
Gimme some.

784
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,960
Freddie,

785
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,970
this is your house?

786
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,920
I thought you lived under a bridge.

787
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,960
Well, technically, it belongs to my parents.

788
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,260
They're on a vacay on the family island.

789
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,840
You know, we should totally go some time. Frolic.

790
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,640
You gotta be kidding me.

792
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,490
If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask,

793
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,160
I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today.

794
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,410
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

795
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,990
Your body temperature is still low.

796
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,030
Yeah.

797
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,580
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

798
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,420
It's so nice.

799
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,300
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

800
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,090
Good robot.

801
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,900
Does this symbol mean anything to you guys?

802
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,060
-Yes! It's a bird! -No!

803
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,290
The guy in the mask was carrying something

804
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,520
with this symbol on it.

805
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,790
Apprehending the man in

806
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,860
the mask will improve Hiro's emotional state.

807
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,620
Apprehend him?

808
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,110
We don't even know who he is.

809
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,870
I have a theory.

810
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,920
"Dr. Slaughter, md"?

811
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,160
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

812
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,620
Malcolm chazzletick.

813
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,210
"The annihilator"?

814
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,920
Behind the mask, industrialist Reid Axworthy.

815
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,130
"Baron Von destruct"? Just get to the point!

816
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,460
Don't you guys get it?

817
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,930
The man in the mask who attacked us

818
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,480
is none other than...

819
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,220
Voila!

820
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,480
Alistair krei.

821
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,180
-What? -Think about it.

822
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,810
Krei wanted your microbots, and you said no.

823
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,430
But rules don't apply to a man like krei.

824
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,480
There's no way. The guy is too high profile.

825
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,530
Then who was that guy in the mask?

826
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,330
I don't know.

827
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,540
We don't know anything about him.

828
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,990
His blood type is ab-negative.

829
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,720
-Cholesterol levels are... - Baymax,

830
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,080
you scanned him?

831
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,920
I am programed to assess everyone's healthcare needs.

832
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,500
Yes!

833
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,040
I can use the data from your scan to find him.

834
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,830
You'd have to scan everyone in San fransokyo.

835
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,010
That might take, I don't know, forever.

836
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,530
No, no, no, no. I...

837
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,880
I just have to look for another angle.

838
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,510
Got it!

839
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,530
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

840
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,230
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

841
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,710
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

842
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,670
I need to upgrade all of you.

843
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,030
Upgrade who, now?

844
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,800
Those who suffer a loss

845
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,700
require support from friends and loved ones.

846
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,240
Okay, I like where this is heading!

847
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,910
We can't go against that guy! We're nerds!

848
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,270
Hiro, we want to help,

849
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,630
but we're just us.

850
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
No.

851
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,230
You can be way more.

852
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,840
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

853
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,960
We're in.

854
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,740
Can you feel it? You guys, do you feel this?

855
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,650
Our origin story begins.

856
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,740
We're gonna be superheroes!

857
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,060
Arms up.

858
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,430
The neurotransmitter must be in his mask.

859
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,820
We get the mask, and he can't control the bots.

860
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,980
Game over.

861
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,050
They say "We are what we are"

862
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,950
But we don't have to be

863
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,680
I'm bad behavior

864
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,710
But I do it in the best way

865
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,930
I'll be the watcher

866
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,100
Of the eternal flame

867
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,500
I'll be the guard dog

868
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,560
Of all your fever dreams

869
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,990
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass

870
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,540
Cause we could be immortals

871
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,300
Immortals

872
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,620
Just not for long for long

873
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,210
Live with me forever now

874
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,700
Pull the blackout curtains down

875
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,470
Just not for long for long

876
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,720
We could be immortals

877
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,520
Immortals

878
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,720
Immortals

879
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:46,320
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith

880
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,860
Is when it's tested again and again every day

881
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,330
I'm still comparing your past to my future

882
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,210
Cause we could be immortals

883
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,780
Immortals

884
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,250
Just not for long for long

885
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,250
Super jump!

886
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,550
Super jump!

887
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,050
Pull the blackout curtains down

888
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:13,970
-I breathe fire. -Just not for long for long

889
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,270
We could be immortals

890
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,780
Immortals

891
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:28,150
Immortals

892
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:32,910
Immortals

893
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,740
Immortals

894
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,220
I love it!

895
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,440
Not bad.

896
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,440
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

897
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,560
Hey, guys!

898
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,640
Check this out.

899
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,320
I'd like to introduce,

900
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,050
Baymax 2.0.

901
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,950
He's glorious.

902
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,590
Hold up. Focus.

903
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,010
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

904
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,430
The fist, show them the fist.

905
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,600
No, not that.

906
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,520
The thing, the other thing.

907
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,870
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

908
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,400
That's just one of his new upgrades!

909
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,330
Baymax, wings.

910
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,170
No way!

911
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,800
Thrusters.

912
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,440
I fail to see how flying

913
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,690
makes me a better healthcare companion.

914
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,770
I fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome!

915
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,310
Full thrust.

916
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,740
Steady, big guy.

917
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,660
Look, let's just take this slow.

918
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,830
Up, up, up, up, up!

919
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,240
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

920
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,040
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

921
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,660
Too much thrust!

922
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
No, no, no, no!

923
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,620
Back on! Back on!

924
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,310
On! On! On!

925
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,320
Go up! Up, up, up!

926
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,970
Oh, man!

927
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,330
Maybe... Maybe enough flying for today.

928
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
What do you say?

929
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,160
Your neurotransmitter levels are rising steadily.

930
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,650
Which means what?

931
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,290
The treatment is working.

932
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,820
Oh, no!

933
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,410
No, no, no, no, no!

934
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,760
Whoa, Baymax!

935
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,090
Yes!

936
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,290
That was...

937
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,410
That was...

938
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,080
Sick.

939
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,290
It is just an expression.

940
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,540
That's... that's right, buddy.

941
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:21,380
I am never taking the bus again.

942
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,430
Your emotional state has improved.

943
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,470
I can deactivate if you say you are satisfied with your care.

944
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,400
What?

945
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,240
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

946
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,910
We still have to find that guy.

947
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,030
So, fire up that super-sensor.

948
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,210
Functionality improved.

949
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,280
1000% increase in range.

950
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,840
I have found a match,

951
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,970
on that island.

952
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,590
-Killer view. -Yeah. If I...

953
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,760
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

954
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,050
I'd probably love this.

955
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,520
But I'm terrified of heights, so I don't love it.

956
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,240
There. Baymax, take us in.

957
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,820
Awesome!

958
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,280
Our first landing together as a team.

959
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,240
Guys, come on.

960
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,500
"Quarantine"?

961
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,410
Do you people know what "Quarantine" Means?

962
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,480
"Quarantine."

963
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,940
Enforced isolation to prevent contamination

964
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,980
that could lead to disease, or, in some cases, death.

965
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,210
There's a skull face on this one.

966
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,420
A skull face!

967
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,800
Be ready.

968
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,840
He could be anywhere.

969
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,060
Fire!

970
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,360
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

971
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,410
That was a bird.

972
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,950
Well, at least we know our gear works.

973
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,100
Six intrepid friends

974
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,520
Led by Fred

975
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,350
Their leader, Fred

976
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,850
Fred's angels

977
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,430
Fred's angels

978
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,370
Harnessing the power of the sun with the

979
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,190
Ancient amulet they found in the attic

980
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,730
The amulet is green

981
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,210
It's probably an emerald

982
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,660
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.

983
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,290
Guys, Shhhh...

984
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,200
Any sign of him, Baymax?

985
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,420
This structure is interfering with my sensor.

986
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,170
Perfect. The robot's broken.

987
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,640
Guys, you might want to see this.

988
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,010
What do you think it is, genius?

989
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,860
I'm not sure. But look.

990
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,610
Hiro.

991
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,260
Krei.

992
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:57,860
That's right.

993
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,400
We were asked to do the impossible.

994
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
That's what we did.

995
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:06,450
We've reinvented the very concept of transportation.

996
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:11,150
Friends, I present project Silent Sparrow.

997
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,930
General, may I?

998
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,720
Magic hat!

999
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,740
Teleportation.

1000
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,120
The transport of matter instantaneously through space.

1001
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,260
Not science fiction anymore.

1002
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:45,960
Now, we didn't spend billions of tax dollars to teleport hats.

1003
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,860
Ladies and gentlemen, you're here to witness history.

1004
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,300
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?

1005
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,620
We've invited all these people.

1006
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,360
Might as well give 'em a show.

1007
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,850
T-minus 30 seconds to launch.

1008
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,580
-29, 28... -This is argo.

1009
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,420
-Capsule's in position. -27...

1010
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,980
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity

1011
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,810
in the magnetic containment field.

1012
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,210
Mr. Krei, is there a problem?

1013
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,810
No. No problem.

1014
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,420
It's well within the parameters.

1015
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,930
Let's move forward.

1016
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,930
3, 2, 1.

1017
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,610
Cabin pressure is go.

1018
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,640
Pod engaged.

1019
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,780
Field breach! Abort!

1020
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,160
We've lost all contact with the pod.

1021
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,540
Oh, no.

1022
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,550
-It's breaking up! -The pilot is gone.

1023
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,200
Portal two is down.

1024
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,370
The magnetic containment field's down!

1025
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,630
Krei, shut it down now!

1026
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,550
I want this island sealed off!

1027
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,390
The government shut down Krei's experiment.

1028
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,340
And he's using your microbots to steal his machine back.

1029
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,480
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1030
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,350
Oh, no.

1031
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,620
Baymax, get us out of here.

1032
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,990
Go for the transmitter.

1033
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,660
Behind his mask.

1034
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,550
Baymax!

1035
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,660
All right, what's the plan?

1036
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,220
It's Fred time.

1037
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,290
Super jump!

1038
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,970
Gravity crush!

1039
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,500
Falling hard.

1040
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,350
Seriously, what is the plan?

1041
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,890
-Get the mask. -Right behind you.

1042
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,100
For real, what is the plan?

1043
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,010
Hey!

1044
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,900
You want to dance, masked man?

1045
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,780
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.

1046
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,900
Hand over the mask, or you'll get a taste of this!

1047
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,160
And a little bit of that!

1048
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,580
Hey! I did all right.

1049
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,670
Is that all you got?

1050
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,250
You got that, too?

1051
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,420
It's back into the fire!

1052
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,240
It's over, Krei.

1053
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,380
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1054
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,790
The explosion...

1055
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,130
You died.

1056
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,800
No. I had your microbots.

1057
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,800
But, Tadashi.

1058
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,070
You just let him die.

1059
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,480
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1060
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,110
He went in there to save you!

1061
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,650
That was his mistake!

1062
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,790
Baymax, destroy.

1063
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,250
My programing prevents me from injuring a human being.

1064
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,700
Not anymore.

1065
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,630
Hiro, this is not what...

1066
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,510
Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!

1067
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,010
No! Stop, Baymax!

1068
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,900
No, stop! He's getting away!

1069
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,740
Baymax!

1070
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,100
My healthcare protocol has been violated.

1071
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,870
I regret any distress I may have caused.

1072
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,360
How could you do that? I had him!

1073
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,360
What you just did, we never signed up for.

1074
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,710
We said we'd catch the guy.

1075
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:31,950
That's it.

1076
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,080
I never should have let you help me!

1077
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,040
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1078
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,220
My enhanced scanner has been damaged.

1079
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,670
Wings.

1080
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,050
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1081
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,550
Fly!

1082
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,340
Hiro!

1083
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,740
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1084
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,170
You appear to be distressed.

1085
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,870
I'm fine!

1086
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,870
There. Is it working?

1087
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,800
- My sensor is operational. - Good.

1088
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,590
Then let's get...

1089
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,290
What?

1090
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,600
Are you going to remove my healthcare chip?

1091
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,420
Yes. Open!

1092
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,510
My purpose is to heal the sick and injured.

1093
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,680
Baymax, open your access port.

1094
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,470
Do you want me to terminate Professor Callaghan?

1095
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,610
Just open!

1096
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,670
Will terminating Professor Callaghan

1097
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,520
improve your emotional state?

1098
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,910
Yes! No! I don't know!

1099
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,150
Open your access!

1100
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,660
- Is this what Tadashi wanted? - It doesn't matter!

1101
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,080
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1102
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,460
Tadashi's gone!

1103
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,380
Tadashi's gone.

1104
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,510
Tadashi is here.

1105
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,050
No. He's not here.

1106
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,090
Tadashi is here.

1107
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,090
This is Tadashi Hamada.

1108
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,940
And this is the first test of my robotics project.

1109
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,440
Hello, I am Baymax.

1110
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,240
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1111
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,370
The seventh test of my robotics project.

1112
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,790
Hello, I...

1113
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,120
What? What?

1114
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,410
Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop scan! Stop...

1115
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,990
Tadashi Hamada again,

1116
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:43,420
and this is the 33rd test of my robotics project.

1117
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,100
I'm not giving up on you.

1118
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,880
You don't understand this yet, but people need you.

1119
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,730
So, let's get back to work.

1120
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,010
This is Tadashi Hamada,

1121
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,650
and this is the 84th test.

1122
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,450
What do you say, big guy?

1123
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,070
Hello, I am Baymax,

1124
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,160
your personal healthcare companion.

1125
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,440
It works.

1126
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,830
It works!

1127
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:17,500
This is amazing! You... you work!

1128
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,090
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.

1129
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,370
I knew it. Oh, you work. I can't believe it! I can't...

1130
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,010
Okay. All right, big moment, here.

1131
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,390
Scan me.

1132
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:32,310
Your neurotransmitter levels are elevated.

1133
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,590
This indicates that you are happy.

1134
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:37,140
I am. I really am.

1135
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,180
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.

1136
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,100
You're gonna help so many people, buddy.

1137
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,850
So many.

1138
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,730
That's all for now. I am satisfied with my care.

1139
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,790
Thank you, Baymax.

1140
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,840
I'm so sorry.

1141
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,540
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1142
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,550
Hiro.

1143
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,060
Guys, I, I...

1144
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,980
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1145
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,360
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1146
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,290
But maybe don't leave your team

1147
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,240
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1148
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,240
- Oh, man. - Nah, it's cool.

1149
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,460
Heathcliff picked us up in the family chopper.

1150
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,410
Hiro, we found something you should see.

1151
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,750
You almost got us all killed!

1152
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,090
Krei! You did this!

1153
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,040
You knew it wasn't ready!

1154
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,970
Callaghan? He was there?

1155
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,270
He was such a good man. What happened?

1156
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,730
I don't know.

1157
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,690
But the answer's here somewhere.

1158
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,350
Wait, wait! Stop.

1159
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,140
There he is.

1160
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
With the pilot.

1161
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:11,400
Hang on.

1162
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,480
We've invited all these people...

1164
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,740
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1165
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,950
Callaghan blames Krei.

1166
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,570
This is a revenge story.

1167
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,670
So, what are we waiting for?

1168
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,670
It's all set up.

1169
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:38,340
This beautiful new campus is the culmination of a lifelong dream.

1170
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:41,130
But none of this would've been possible

1171
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,600
without a few bumps in the road.

1172
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:47,670
Those setbacks made us stronger,

1174
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,530
and set us on the path to a bright future.

1175
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,110
What is that?

1176
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,600
- What? - Setback?

1177
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,490
Was my daughter a "Setback"?

1178
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,920
Callaghan! But you...

1179
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,010
Your daughter, that...

1180
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,500
That was an accident.

1181
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,540
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1182
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,270
My daughter is gone because of your arrogance.

1183
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,140
What are you doing?

1184
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,140
You took everything from me

1185
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,450
when you sent Abigail into that machine.

1186
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,250
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1187
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,580
No!

1188
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,330
No! No! You can't!

1189
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,060
You're going to watch everything you've built disappear.

1190
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,810
Then, it's your turn.

1191
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,670
Professor Callaghan!

1192
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,320
Let him go!

1193
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,280
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1194
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,190
Abigail is gone!

1195
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,530
This won't change anything. Trust me, I know.

1196
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,400
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1197
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,620
Please, let me go.

1198
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,790
I'll give you anything you want!

1199
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,420
I want my daughter back!

1200
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,290
Go for the mask!

1201
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,570
Baymax!

1202
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,230
Leaping into action!

1203
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,680
Oh, no!

1204
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,510
Getting a little... A little tight.

1205
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,780
- No! - He's too strong!

1206
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,130
- There's no way out! - You can't beat him!

1207
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,620
Help! I can't beat him.

1208
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,050
Hiro!

1209
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,470
- Hiro? Hiro? - Help!

1210
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,180
- That's it! - Hiro.

1211
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,590
- I know how to beat him. - Hiro.

1212
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,640
Listen up!

1213
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,050
Use those big brains of yours,

1214
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,600
and think your way around the problem.

1215
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,170
Look for a new angle.

1216
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,230
My arms! They can't go any further!

1217
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,750
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1218
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,620
Hello, sign.

1219
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,120
Care to go for a little spin?

1220
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,750
Double spin!

1221
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:36,910
Behind-the-back spin!

1222
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,770
Baymax!

1223
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,780
Hiro.

1224
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,130
I love that robot!

1225
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,130
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.

1226
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,560
Take out the bots. They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1227
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,230
Now that is a plan!

1228
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,430
Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover?

1229
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,400
Like you have to ask.

1230
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,640
Let's do this, Freddie!

1231
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,610
Smokescreen!

1232
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,150
Ready and

1233
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,250
dive!

1234
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,210
Whoa, the gravity's getting a little weird here, guys!

1235
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,760
Wait. Let's use this!

1236
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,850
These are green blades of fury!

1237
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,800
Woman up!

1238
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,890
Double sign-spin.

1239
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,280
Now my signs are on fire!

1240
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,630
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1241
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:45,220
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1242
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,750
Hammerfist.

1243
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,380
This ends now!

1244
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,070
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1245
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,310
What?

1246
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,410
Baymax!

1247
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,240
No!

1248
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,210
Our programing prevents us from injuring a human being.

1249
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,800
But we'll take that.

1250
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,540
It's still on! We have to shut it down!

1251
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,000
We can't! The containment field is failing.

1252
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,420
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1253
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,290
We need to get out of here, now!

1254
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,970
Baymax!

1255
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,350
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1256
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,380
- What? - Coming from there.

1257
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,310
The life signs are female.

1258
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,730
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1259
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,070
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.

1260
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,610
Abigail.

1261
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,440
Let's go get her.

1262
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,320
The portal is destabilizing. You'll never make it.

1263
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:36,490
She's alive in there.

1264
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,370
Someone has to help.

1265
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,280
What do you say, buddy?

1266
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,160
Flying makes me a better healthcare companion.

1267
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,940
Careful! There's Krei tech debris everywhere.

1268
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,120
Look out!

1269
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,430
I have located the patient.

1270
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,680
Hurry!

1271
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,920
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1272
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,540
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1273
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,090
Veer right!

1274
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,020
Okay, to the left.

1275
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,230
Hard right!

1276
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,680
Up and over.

1277
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,270
Okay, level off. Easy.

1278
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,440
Nice flying!

1279
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,360
Almost there!

1280
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,630
Baymax!

1281
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:00,220
Baymax!

1282
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,300
My thrusters are inoperable.

1283
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,430
Just grab hold.

1284
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:24,400
There is still a way I can get you both to safety.

1285
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,330
I cannot deactivate until you say

1286
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,450
you are satisfied with your care.

1287
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,950
No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you?

1288
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,830
- You are my patient. - Baymax.

1289
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,420
Your health is my only concern.

1290
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,170
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1291
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,920
Are you satisfied with your care?

1292
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,850
No. There's gotta be another way.

1293
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,970
I'm not gonna leave you here. I'll think of something.

1294
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,520
There is no time.

1295
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,430
Are you satisfied with your care?

1296
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,140
Please! No.

1297
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,320
I can't lose you, too.

1298
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,780
Hiro, I will always be with you.

1299
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,890
I'm satisfied with my care.

1300
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,930
Hiro!

1301
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,100
Yeah! They made it!

1302
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,060
Baymax?

1303
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:31,750
Miss, can you hear me?

1304
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,460
What is your name?

1305
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,570
Abigail Callaghan.

1306
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,380
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.

1307
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,800
We're taking you to the hospital.

1308
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,040
Move it!

1309
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,550
Get in there.

1310
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,150
A massive cleanup continues today

1311
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,320
at the headquarters of Krei Tech Industries.

1313
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:06,730
Reports are still flooding in

1314
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,830
about a group of unidentified individuals,

1315
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,110
who prevented what could have been a major catastrophe.

1316
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,820
The whole city of San Fransokyo is asking,

1317
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,320
"Who are these heroes? And where are they now?"

1318
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,080
It's so exciting.

1319
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:22,510
Hey, sweetie!

1320
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,760
Okay.

1321
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,340
Last hug.

1322
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:31,680
Bye!

1323
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,340
- And just then I was like... - Get out of here.

1324
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,720
I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.

1325
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,530
Hello, Hiro.

1326
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,700
We didn't set out to be superheroes,

1327
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:43,080
but sometimes life doesn't go the way you planned.

1328
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,260
The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people,

1329
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,000
and that's what we're gonna do.

1330
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,720
Who are we?

1334
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:26,440
Dad, I just wish I could share my accomplishments with you.

1335
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:28,450
You mean so much to me, and honestly,

1336
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,940
I've always felt a distance

1337
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:33,360
what with you being on the family island all the time,

1338
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,730
and I just wish you could see how...

1339
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,130
Fred.

1340
01:40:58,970 --> 01:40:59,970
Son.

1341
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:01,940
Dad?

1342
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:08,310
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.

1343
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:13,620
I go inside out, then I go front and back.

1344
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:14,990
Dad!

1345
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,290
We have a lot to talk about.

2
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,980
Get up! Get up!

3
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,460
The winner,

4
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,720
by total annihilation,

5
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,680
Yama!

6
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,020
Who is next?

7
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Who has the guts to step into the ring with little Yama?

8
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,180
Yama!

9
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,730
Can I try?

10
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,150
I have a robot. I built it myself.

11
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,120
Beat it, kid.

12
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,040
House rules. You gotta pay to play.

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,500
Is this enough?

14
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,540
What's your name, little boy?

15
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,340
Hiro. Hiro Hamada.

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,090
Prepare your bot, zero.

17
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,560
Two bots enter,

18
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,860
one bot leaves.

19
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,990
Fighters ready?

20
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,270
Fight!

21
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,340
That was my first fight. I... Can I try again?

22
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,370
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

23
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,250
Go home.

24
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,870
I've got more money.

25
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,340
Fighters ready?

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,980
Fight!

27
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,260
Mega-bot, destroy.

28
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,820
What?

29
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,630
- No more little Yama. - But, wha...

30
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,420
This is not possible!

31
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,230
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

32
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,800
Beginner's luck.

33
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,310
Do you want to go again, Yama?

34
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,280
No one hustles Yama!

35
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,860
Teach him a lesson.

36
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,980
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.

37
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,950
- Hiro! Get on! - Tadashi!

38
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,620
Good timing!

39
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,830
Oh, mama!

40
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,540
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,890
- Are you hurt? - No.

42
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,010
Then what were you thinking, knucklehead?

43
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,770
You graduated high school when you were 13,

44
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,890
and this is what you're doing?

45
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
There they are!

46
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,530
Hold on!

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,770
Yes!

48
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,310
Get back here.

49
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,440
Bot fighting is illegal.

50
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,240
You're going to get yourself arrested.

51
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Bot fighting is not illegal.

52
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,910
Betting on bot fighting, that's... that's illegal.

53
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,170
But so lucrative!

54
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,630
I'm on a roll, big brother! And there is no stopping me!

55
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Oh, no.

57
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,980
Hi, Aunt Cass.

58
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,050
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.

59
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,610
- We're fine. - We're okay.

60
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,930
Oh, good.

61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,030
Then what were you two knuckleheads thinking?

62
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
For 10 years,

63
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,660
I have done the best I could to raise you.

64
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,520
Have I been perfect? No.

65
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,580
Do I know anything about children? No.

66
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,490
Should I have picked up a book on parenting?

67
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,830
Probably!

68
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,120
Where was I going with this? I had a point.

69
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,380
- Sorry. - We love you, Aunt Cass.

70
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,910
Well, I love you, too!

71
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,010
I had to close up early because of you two felons.

72
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,290
On beat poetry night.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,090
Stress eating. Because of you.

74
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,340
Come on, Mochi.

75
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,470
This is really good!

76
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,820
You better make this up to Aunt Cass

77
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,340
before she eats everything in the cafe.

78
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,640
For sure.

79
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,940
And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.

80
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,970
Absolutely.

81
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,860
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

82
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,320
There's a fight across town. If I book, I can still make it.

83
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,730
When are you gonna

84
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,780
start doing something with that big brain of yours?

85
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,700
What? Go to college like you?

86
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,580
So people can tell me stuff I already know?

87
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,420
Unbelievable.

88
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,030
What would mom and dad say?

89
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,300
I don't know.

90
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,010
They're gone.

91
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,380
They died when I was three, remember?

92
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,130
- I'll take you. - Really?

93
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,420
I can't stop you from going,

94
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,880
but I'm not going to let you go on your own.

95
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,190
Sweet.

97
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,860
What are we doing at your nerd school?

98
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,560
Bot-fight's that way!

100
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,110
Gotta grab something.

101
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,810
Is this gonna take long?

102
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,280
Relax, you big baby. We'll be in and out.

103
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,910
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,750
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

105
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,990
Heads up!

106
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,640
Electro-mag suspension?

107
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,270
- Who are you? - I'm...

108
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,350
Go go, this is my brother Hiro.

109
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,990
Welcome to the nerd lab.

110
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Yeah.

111
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,660
I've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.

112
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,330
Zero resistance, faster bike.

113
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,160
But, not fast enough,

114
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,710
yet.

115
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,170
Do not move. Behind the line, please.

116
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,970
Hey, Wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.

117
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,560
Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.

118
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,630
Catch.

119
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,610
- Laser-induced plasma? - Oh, yeah.

120
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,610
With a little magnetic confinement for ultra-precision.

121
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,820
Wow. How do you find anything in this mess?

122
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,820
I have a system.

123
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,950
There's a place for everything,

124
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,900
and everything in its place.

125
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,410
- Need this! - You can't do that!

126
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,610
This is anarchy! Society has rules!

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,460
Excuse me!

128
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,070
Coming through!

129
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,740
Tadashi!

130
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,870
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

131
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I've heard so much about you!

132
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,290
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

133
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,890
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

134
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,630
400 pounds of it!

135
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,960
Come here, come here, come here.

136
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,760
You're going to love this.

137
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,050
A dash of perchloric acid, a smidge of cobalt,

138
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,730
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

139
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,350
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...

140
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,810
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

141
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,360
It's so pink.

142
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,280
Here's the best part.

143
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,040
I know, right?

144
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,410
Chemical metal embrittlement.

145
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,050
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

146
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,830
"Honey Lemon"? "Go go"? "Wasabi"?

147
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,050
I spill wasabi on my shirt one time, people.

148
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,510
One time!

149
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,810
Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.

150
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,350
Who's Fred?

151
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,930
This guy, right here!

152
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,650
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,190
This is not my real face and body.

154
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,470
The name's Fred.

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,520
School mascot by day, but by night,

156
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,650
I am also a school mascot.

157
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,200
So, what's your major?

158
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,740
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

159
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,910
But I am a major science enthusiast.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,120
I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula,

161
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,250
that can turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will.

162
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,660
But she says that's "Not science."

163
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,910
It's really not.

164
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,630
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

165
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,590
I asked Wasabi for isn't "Science" either.

166
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,790
- Is it? - Nope.

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,630
Well, then, what about "Invisible sandwich"?

168
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,840
- Hiro. - Imagine eating a sandwich,

169
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,920
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

170
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,050
Just stop.

171
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,340
- Laser eyes? - What?

172
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,220
- Tingly fingers? - Never gonna happen.

173
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,470
Hey, what about a growth serum?

174
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,610
So, what have you been working on?

175
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,930
I'll show you.

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,060
Duct tape?

177
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,020
I hate to break it to you, bro.

178
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,310
Already been invented.

179
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,870
Dude!

180
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Ow!

181
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,170
This is what I've been working on.

182
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
Hello. I am Baymax.

183
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,240
Your personal healthcare companion.

184
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,700
I was alerted to the need

185
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,160
for medical attention when you said, "Ow."

186
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,440
A robotic nurse.

187
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,490
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

188
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,490
Physical or emotional?

189
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,790
I will scan you now.

190
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,160
Scan complete.

191
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,880
You have a slight epidermal abrasion on your forearm.

192
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,590
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

193
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,260
What's in the spray, specifically?

194
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,350
The primary ingredient is Bacitracin.

195
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,020
That's a bummer. I'm actually allergic to that.

196
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,110
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

197
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,650
You do have a mild allergy to peanuts.

198
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,350
Not bad.

199
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,030
You've done some serious coding on this thing, huh?

200
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,150
Programed him with over 10,000 medical procedures.

202
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,830
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.

203
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,670
Vinyl?

204
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,960
Yeah, going for a non-threatening, huggable kind of thing.

205
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,170
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

206
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,800
- No offense. - I am a robot.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,210
I cannot be offended.

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,390
- Hyperspectral cameras? -Yep.

209
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,100
- Titanium skeleton? - Carbon fiber.

210
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,440
Right. Even lighter.

211
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,890
Killer actuators. Where did you get those?

212
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,640
Machined them right here, in-house.

213
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,030
- Really? - Yup.

214
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,690
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

215
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Shut up.

216
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,520
You have been a good boy. Have a lollipop.

217
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,870
Nice.

218
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,090
I cannot deactivate until you say

219
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,450
you are satisfied with your care.

220
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,450
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

221
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,580
He's going to help a lot of people.

222
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,700
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

223
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Lithium ion.

224
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,720
You know, supercapacitors would charge way faster.

225
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,960
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?

226
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,050
Hey, Professor.

227
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,090
Actually, I was just finishing up.

228
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,390
You must be Hiro.

229
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,050
Bot-fighter, right?

230
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,900
When my daughter was younger, that's all she wanted to do.

231
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,140
May I?

232
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,600
Sure.

233
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,070
Magnetic-bearing servos.

234
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,450
Pretty sick, huh?

235
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,770
Wanna see how I put 'em together?

236
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,330
Hey, genius!

237
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,280
He invented them.

238
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,740
You're Robert Callaghan?

239
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,570
Like, as in,

240
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,450
the Callaghan-catmull spline,

241
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,080
and Callaghan's "Laws of robotics"?

242
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,290
That's right.

243
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,120
Ever think about applying here?

244
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,670
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

245
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I don't know.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,250
He's pretty serious about his career in bot-fighting.

247
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,750
Well, kind of serious.

248
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,970
I can see why.

249
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,090
With your bot, winning must come easy.

250
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,010
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,200
Well, if you like things easy,

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,520
then my program isn't for you.

253
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,020
We push the boundaries of robotics here.

254
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,650
My students go on to shape the future.

255
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,450
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

256
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,030
Good luck with the bot-fights.

257
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,950
We gotta hurry if you want to catch that bot-fight.

258
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,750
I have to go here.

259
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,460
If I don't go to this nerd school,

260
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,830
I'm gonna lose my mind.

261
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
How do I get in?

263
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,220
Every year, the school has a student showcase.

264
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,200
You come up with something that blows Callaghan away,

265
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,930
you're in.

266
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,720
But, it's gotta be great.

268
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,140
Trust me.

269
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,300
It will be.

270
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,730
Nothing!

271
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,990
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!

272
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,330
Wow. Washed up at 14.

273
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,450
So sad.

274
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,330
I got nothing! I'm done. I'm never getting in.

275
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,340
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.

276
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,380
What are you doing?

277
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,840
Shake things up.

278
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,340
Use that big brain of yours to think your way out.

279
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,510
- What? - Look for a new angle.

280
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,210
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.

281
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,550
How are you feeling?

282
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,380
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.

283
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,230
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

284
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,440
Yep, he's nervous.

285
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,890
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

286
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,730
- He's so tense. - No, I'm not.

287
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,400
Relax, Hiro.

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,310
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go go.

289
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,040
Stop whining. Woman up.

290
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm fine!

291
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,560
What do you need, little man? Deodorant? Breath mint?

292
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Fresh pair of underpants?

293
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,790
Underpants? You need serious help.

294
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey, I come prepared.

295
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,110
I haven't done laundry in six months.

296
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,420
One pair lasts me four days.

297
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,570
I go front, I go back,

298
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,740
I go inside-out. Then I go front and back.

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,170
Wow. That is both disgusting and awesome.

300
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,510
Don't encourage him.

301
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,080
It's called "Recycling."

302
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,850
Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.

303
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,800
Oh, yeah. This is it.

304
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,970
I guess I'm up.

305
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,260
Okay, photo, photo! Everybody say, "Hiro."

306
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,840
- Hiro! - Yeah!

307
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,600
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

308
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,190
- Don't mess it up. - Break a leg, little man.

309
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,820
Science, yeah!

310
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,100
All right, bro. This is it.

311
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,700
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

312
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,780
What's going on?

313
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,330
I really want to go here.

314
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
You got this.

315
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,290
My name is Hiro...

316
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,930
Sorry.

317
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,770
My name is Hiro Hamada,

318
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,310
and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool.

319
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,310
I hope you like it.

320
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,150
This is a microbot.

321
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,460
Breathe.

322
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,660
It doesn't look like much,

323
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,040
but when it links up with the rest of its pals,

324
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,510
things get a little more interesting.

325
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,910
The microbots are controlled with this neural transmitter.

326
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,530
I think what I want them to do...

327
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,580
They do it.

328
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,870
The applications for this tech are limitless.

329
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,510
Construction.

330
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,340
What used to take teams of people working by hand

331
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,760
for months or years,

332
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,560
can now be accomplished by one person.

333
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,050
And that's just the beginning.

334
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,760
How about transportation?

335
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,390
Microbots can move anything anywhere,

336
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,200
with ease.

337
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,580
If you can think it, the microbots can do it.

338
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
The only limit is your imagination.

339
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,930
Microbots!

340
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,390
That's my nephew!

341
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,690
Yes!

342
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,480
My family! I love my family!

343
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,270
Nailed it!

344
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,270
- You did it! - Not bad!

345
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,280
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!

346
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,770
They loved you. That was amazing!

347
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,280
Yes.

348
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,580
With some development, your tech could be revolutionary.

349
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,820
Alistair Krei!

350
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,460
May I?

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,130
Extraordinary.

352
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,470
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

353
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,170
Shut up.

354
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,830
Mr. Krei is right.

355
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,840
Your microbots are an inspired piece of tech.

356
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,630
You can continue to develop them,

357
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,310
or you can sell them to a man

358
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,520
who's only guided by his own self-interest.

359
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,440
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

360
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,680
but it shouldn't affect...

361
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,470
This is your decision, Hiro.

362
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,690
But you should know

363
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,650
Mr. Krei has cut corners and ignored sound science

364
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
to get where he is.

365
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,150
That's just not true.

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,060
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech

367
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,870
with your microbots,

368
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,500
or anything else.

369
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,420
Hiro, I'm offering you

370
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,030
more money than any 14-year-old could imagine.

371
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,060
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,

372
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,460
but they're not for sale.

373
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,390
I thought you were smarter than that.

374
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,960
Robert.

375
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,060
Mr. Krei.

376
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,390
That's my brother's.

377
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,860
That's right.

378
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,200
I look forward to seeing you in class.

379
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,870
Unbelievable!

380
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,150
That's what I'm talking about.

381
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,960
All right, geniuses,

382
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,370
let's feed those hungry brains.

383
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Back to the cafe!

384
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,880
Dinner is on me!

385
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,880
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

386
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,870
- Aunt Cass? - Unless it's moldy.

387
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,370
We'll... we'll catch up, okay?

388
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,720
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

389
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,590
Both of you.

390
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,930
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

391
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,270
I know what you're going to say.

392
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,190
"I should be proud of myself,"

393
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,110
"because I'm finally using my gift for something important."

394
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,270
No, no. I was just gonna

395
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,030
tell you your fly was down for the whole show.

396
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,110
Ha-ha-hilarious.

397
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,080
What?

398
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,130
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

399
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,450
Hey, I...

400
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,430
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. So,

401
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,430
you know,

402
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,430
thanks for not giving up on me.

403
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,100
Are you okay?

404
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,780
Yeah. I'm okay.

405
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,570
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.

406
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,440
Tadashi, no!

407
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,420
Callaghan's in there.

408
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,790
Someone has to help.

409
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,810
Tadashi!

410
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,480
Tadashi!

411
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,040
Here. Have some tea.

412
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,240
Hey, sweetie.

413
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,690
Hey, Aunt Cass.

414
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,620
Mrs. Matsuda's in the cafe.

415
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,080
She's wearing something super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.

416
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,410
That always cracks you up.

417
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,580
You should come down.

418
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,960
Maybe later.

419
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,050
The university called again.

420
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,290
It's been a few weeks since classes started.

421
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,710
But they said it's not too late to register.

422
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,470
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.

424
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,950
Hey, Hiro.

425
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,820
We just wanted to check in, and see how you're doing.

426
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,090
We wish you were here, buddy.

427
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,120
Hiro, if I could have only one superpower right now,

428
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,670
it would be the ability to crawl through this camera,

429
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,130
and give you a big hug.

430
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Ow!

431
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,060
Hello. I am Baymax,

432
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,020
your personal healthcare companion.

433
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,020
Hey, Baymax.

434
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,860
I didn't know you were still active.

435
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,030
I heard a sound of distress.

436
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,650
What seems to be the trouble?

437
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,750
I just stubbed my toe a little.

438
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm fine.

439
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,200
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

440
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,210
A zero. I'm okay, really.

441
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,290
Thanks. You can shrink now.

442
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,970
Does it hurt when I touch it?

443
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,930
That's okay. No touching.

444
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,590
I'm fine...

445
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,050
You have fallen.

446
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,230
You think?

447
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,740
- On a scale of 1 to... - Ow!

448
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,100
On a scale...

449
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,270
On a sca...

450
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,620
On a scale of 1 to 10...

451
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,280
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

452
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,080
Zero.

453
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,450
- It is all right to cry. - No. No, no, no, no.

454
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,240
Crying is a natural response to pain.

455
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,410
I'm not crying.

456
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,910
- I will scan you for injuries. - Don't scan me.

457
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,750
- Scan complete. - Unbelievable.

458
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,760
You have sustained no injuries.

459
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,420
However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels

460
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,420
indicate that you are experiencing mood swings,

461
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,800
common in adolescence.

462
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,420
Diagnosis, puberty.

463
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,770
What?

464
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,350
Okay. Time to shrink now.

465
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,470
You should expect an increase in body hair,

466
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,110
especially on your face, chest, armpits, and...

467
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,490
Thank you! That's enough.

468
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,270
You may also experience strange and powerful new urges.

469
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,280
Okay! Let's get you back in your luggage.

470
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,510
I cannot deactivate until you say

471
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,450
you are satisfied with your care.

472
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,120
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

473
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,470
My microbot?

474
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,960
This doesn't make any sense.

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,430
Puberty can often be a confusing time

476
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,650
for a young adolescent flowering into manhood.

477
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,640
No. The thing is attracted to the other microbots,

478
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,640
but that's impossible.

479
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,810
They were destroyed in the fire.

480
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,990
Dumb thing's broken.

481
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,160
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

482
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,340
Oh, yeah?

483
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,010
Why don't you find out where it's trying to go?

484
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,660
Would that stabilize your pubescent mood swings?

485
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,220
Absolutely.

486
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,180
Baymax?

487
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,350
Baymax?

488
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,650
Baymax?

489
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,410
What?

490
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,540
- Hiro? - Hey, Aunt Cass!

491
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,910
Wow. You're up and...

492
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,870
Yeah! I figured it was time.

493
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,910
Are you registering for school?

494
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Yes.

495
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,950
I thought about what you said. Really inspired me.

496
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,380
Oh, honey, that's so great.

497
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,880
Okay,

498
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,300
special dinner tonight.

499
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,800
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

500
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,390
You know, with the hot sauce that makes our faces numb.

501
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,220
- Okay, sounds good. - Great!

502
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,890
Last hug.

503
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,070
Baymax!

504
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,240
Baymax!

505
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Watch it!

506
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,810
Baymax!

507
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,280
Baymax!

508
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,110
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

509
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,860
I have found where your tiny robot wants to go.

510
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,460
I told you, it's broken. It's not trying to go...

511
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,670
Locked.

512
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,890
There is a window.

513
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,840
Please exercise caution.

514
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,400
A fall from this height could lead to bodily harm.

515
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,380
Oh, no.

516
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,380
Excuse me while I let out some air.

517
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
Are you done?

518
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,350
Yes.

519
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,110
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

520
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,680
Fine, just keep it down.

521
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,570
My microbots?

522
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,120
Someone's making more.

523
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,340
Hiro?

524
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,750
You gave me a heart attack!

525
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,090
My hands are equipped with defibrillators. Clear.

526
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,920
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression.

527
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,300
Oh, no.

528
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,640
Run!

529
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,810
Oh, come on!

530
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,310
I am not fast.

531
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,940
Yeah, no kidding!

532
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,610
Go! Go! Come on.

533
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,030
Kick it down!

534
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,950
Then punch it!

535
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,130
Go! Go!

536
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,500
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

537
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Move it!

538
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,800
Come on!

539
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,320
No, no.

540
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,410
Come on! The window!

541
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,490
Suck it in!

542
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,340
Baymax!

543
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,000
Hiro?

544
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,100
Come on, let's get out of here.

545
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,020
Go! Hurry!

546
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,100
All right, let me get this straight.

547
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,200
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

548
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,520
with an army of miniature flying robots.

549
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,190
"Microbots."

550
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,370
-Microbots. -Yeah.

551
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,910
He was controlling them

552
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,280
telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter.

553
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,210
So, Mr. Kabuki was using esp

554
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,050
to attack you and balloon man.

555
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,820
Did you file a report when your flying robots were stolen?

556
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,090
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

557
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,620
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

558
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,330
but Baymax was there, too.

559
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,470
-Tell him. -Yes, officer.

560
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,420
He's telling the truth.

561
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,760
What the... What's wrong with you?

562
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,600
Low battery.

563
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,430
Try to keep it together.

564
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,610
I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion.

565
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,300
Kid, how about we call your parents,

566
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,610
and get them down here?

567
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,940
What?

568
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,690
Write your name and number down

569
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,290
on this piece of paper, and we can...

570
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,130
I've gotta get you home to your charging station.

571
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Can you walk?

572
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,120
I will scan you now. Scan complete.

573
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,680
Healthcare.

574
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Okay.

575
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,390
If my aunt asks, we were at school all day. Got it?

576
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,890
We jumped out a window.

577
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,780
No! Quiet!

578
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,660
We jumped out a window.

579
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,980
You can't say things like that around aunt Cass.

580
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,340
Hiro?

581
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,660
You home, sweetie?

582
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,680
That's right.

583
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,380
I thought I heard you.

584
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,670
Hey, aunt Cass.

585
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,010
Look at my little college man.

586
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,230
I can't wait to hear all about it!

587
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,510
And wings are almost ready.

588
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Whee!

589
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Will you be quiet?

590
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,680
Yeah, wings! Whee!

591
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,570
All right, get ready to have your face melted.

592
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,690
We are gonna feel these things tomorrow.

593
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,190
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Okay.

595
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,870
Sit down. Tell me everything.

596
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,630
The thing is that, since I registered so late,

597
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,120
I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.

598
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,580
What was that?

599
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,380
Mochi.

600
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,890
That darn cat.

601
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,560
At least take a plate for the road, okay?

602
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,890
-Don't work too... -Thanks for understanding.

603
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:39,060
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

604
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,360
All right, come on.

605
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm healthcare, your personal baymax companion.

606
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,690
One foot in front of the other.

607
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,680
This doesn't make any sense.

608
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,210
Tadashi.

609
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,340
What?

610
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,020
Tadashi.

611
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,980
Tadashi's gone.

612
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,400
When will he return?

613
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,820
He's dead, baymax.

614
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,660
Tadashi was in excellent health.

615
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,900
With a proper diet and exercise,

616
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,960
he should have lived a long life.

617
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,910
Yeah, he should have.

618
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,380
But there was a fire and...

619
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,540
Now, he's gone.

620
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,050
-Tadashi is here. -No.

621
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,680
People keep saying he's not really gone.

622
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,140
As long as we remember him.

623
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,640
It still hurts.

624
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,640
I see no evidence of physical injury.

625
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,570
It's a different kind of hurt.

626
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,870
You are my patient.

627
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,310
I would like to help.

628
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,480
You can't fix this one, buddy.

629
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,410
What are you doing?

630
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,740
I am downloading a database on personal loss.

631
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,450
Database downloaded.

632
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,050
Treatments include contact with friends and loved ones.

637
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,500
I am contacting them now.

638
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,170
No, no, no! I... Don't do that.

639
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,630
Your friends have been contacted.

640
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
Unbelievable.

641
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,430
Now, what are you doing?

642
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,390
Other treatments include compassion and physical reassurance.

643
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,900
I'm okay. Really.

644
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,140
You will be all right. There, there.

645
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,820
Thanks, Baymax.

646
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,450
I am sorry about the fire.

647
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,570
It's okay. It was an accident.

648
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,870
Unless...

649
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,210
Unless it wasn't.

650
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,700
At the showcase,

651
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,380
that guy in the mask stole my microbots. And...

652
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,090
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.

653
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,170
He's responsible for Tadashi.

654
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,600
We gotta catch that guy.

655
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,840
It's alive!

656
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,440
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!

657
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,810
If we're gonna catch that guy,

658
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,610
you need some upgrades.

659
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,770
Will apprehending the man

660
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,360
in the mask improve your emotional state?

661
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,190
Absolutely.

662
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,000
Let's work on your moves.

663
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,090
Now, let's take care of this.

664
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,040
I have some concerns.

665
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,060
This armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.

666
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,960
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

668
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,890
You look sick.

669
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,270
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

670
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,010
It's just an expression.

671
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,270
Data transfer complete.

673
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,330
I fail to see

674
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,920
how karate makes me a better healthcare companion.

675
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,590
You want to keep me healthy, don't you?

676
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,960
Punch this.

677
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,840
Yes! Hammerfist!

678
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,600
Side kick!

679
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,970
Knifehand!

680
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,610
Back kick!

681
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,690
Gummy bears!

682
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,120
Yes!

683
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,330
Yeah! Fist bump!

684
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,220
"Fist bump" Is not in my fighting database.

685
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,800
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

686
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,140
It's what people do sometimes

687
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,930
when they're excited or pumped up.

688
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,060
Hey, now you're getting it.

689
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,780
I will add "Fist bump" to my care-giving matrix.

690
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,280
All right. Let's go get that guy.

691
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,370
Come on!

692
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,350
Get him, Baymax!

693
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,780
We're too late.

694
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,520
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

695
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,450
Come on.

696
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,880
Always wait one hour after eating before swimming.

697
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,400
Come on!

698
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,320
Your heart rate has increased dramatic...

699
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,050
Okay, Baymax, time to use those upgrades.

700
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,440
-Hiro? -No, no, no!

701
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,890
Get out of here! Go!

702
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,640
Dude, what are you doing out here?

703
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,270
Nothing! Just out for a walk.

704
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,100
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

705
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,410
Is that Baymax?

706
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,150
Yeah, but you really...

707
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,940
Why is he wearing carbon fiber underpants?

708
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,750
I also know karate.

709
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,030
You guys need to go.

710
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,890
No, don't push us away, Hiro.

711
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,080
We're here for you.

712
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,750
That's why Baymax contacted us.

713
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,250
Those who suffer a loss,

714
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,670
require support from friends and loved ones.

715
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,870
Okay, but I...

716
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,800
Who would like to share their feelings first?

717
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,460
I'll go. Okay.

718
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,130
My name is Fred, and it has been 30 days since my last...

719
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,000
Holy mother of megazon!

720
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,930
Am I the only one seeing this?

721
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,220
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

722
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,060
Go!

723
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,610
Baymax, get him!

724
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,080
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

725
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,530
I'm saving your life.

726
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,900
Baymax can handle that guy!

727
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,490
Oh, no.

728
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,420
Wasabi!

729
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,130
Goodbye!

730
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,050
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

731
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,890
He stole my microbots. He started the fire.

732
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,510
I don't know who he is!

733
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,260
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

734
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,430
Hard left!

735
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,000
That mask, the black suit...

736
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,340
We're under attack from a super villain, people!

737
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,080
I mean, how cool is that?

738
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,370
I mean, it's scary, obviously. But how cool!

739
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,970
Why are we stopped?

740
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,010
The light's red!

741
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,640
There are no red lights in a car chase!

742
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,590
Why is he trying to kill us?

743
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,970
Why are you trying to kill us?

744
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,940
It's classic villain. We've seen too much!

745
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,320
Let's not jump to conclusions.

746
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,310
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

747
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,610
Car!

748
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,940
He's trying to kill us!

749
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,320
Did you just put your blinker on?

750
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,900
You have to indicate your turn!

751
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,190
It's the law!

752
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,250
That's it.

753
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,990
Stop the car!

754
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,320
Baymax and I can take this guy!

755
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,660
Seatbelts save lives.

756
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,290
Buckle up, every time.

757
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,000
What are you doing? What are you doing?

758
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,140
What are you doing? What are you doing?

759
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,850
-Did we lose him? -Look out!

760
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,440
Baymax, hold on!

761
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,040
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

762
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,400
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

763
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,240
-We're not gonna make it! -We're gonna make it!

764
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,250
We made it! Yes!

765
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,780
I told you we'd make it!

766
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
Your injuries require my attention.

767
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,250
And your body temperatures are low.

768
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,960
We should get out of here.

769
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,010
I know a place.

770
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,040
Where are we?

771
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,880
Fred.

772
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,350
Where are you going?

773
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,510
Welcome to mi casa.

775
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,360
That's French for "Front door."

776
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,180
It's really not.

777
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,530
Listen, nitwit.

778
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,190
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

779
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,810
I'm not in the mood for any...

780
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,480
Welcome home, master Frederick.

781
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,370
Heathcliff, my man!

782
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,820
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.

783
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,120
Gimme some.

784
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,960
Freddie,

785
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,970
this is your house?

786
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,920
I thought you lived under a bridge.

787
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,960
Well, technically, it belongs to my parents.

788
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,260
They're on a vacay on the family island.

789
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,840
You know, we should totally go some time. Frolic.

790
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,640
You gotta be kidding me.

792
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,490
If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask,

793
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,160
I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today.

794
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,410
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

795
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,990
Your body temperature is still low.

796
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,030
Yeah.

797
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,580
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

798
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,420
It's so nice.

799
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,300
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

800
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,090
Good robot.

801
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,900
Does this symbol mean anything to you guys?

802
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,060
-Yes! It's a bird! -No!

803
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,290
The guy in the mask was carrying something

804
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,520
with this symbol on it.

805
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,790
Apprehending the man in

806
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,860
the mask will improve Hiro's emotional state.

807
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,620
Apprehend him?

808
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,110
We don't even know who he is.

809
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,870
I have a theory.

810
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,920
"Dr. Slaughter, md"?

811
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,160
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

812
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,620
Malcolm chazzletick.

813
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,210
"The annihilator"?

814
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,920
Behind the mask, industrialist Reid Axworthy.

815
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,130
"Baron Von destruct"? Just get to the point!

816
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,460
Don't you guys get it?

817
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,930
The man in the mask who attacked us

818
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,480
is none other than...

819
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,220
Voila!

820
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,480
Alistair krei.

821
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,180
-What? -Think about it.

822
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,810
Krei wanted your microbots, and you said no.

823
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,430
But rules don't apply to a man like krei.

824
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,480
There's no way. The guy is too high profile.

825
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,530
Then who was that guy in the mask?

826
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,330
I don't know.

827
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,540
We don't know anything about him.

828
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,990
His blood type is ab-negative.

829
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,720
-Cholesterol levels are... - Baymax,

830
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,080
you scanned him?

831
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,920
I am programed to assess everyone's healthcare needs.

832
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,500
Yes!

833
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,040
I can use the data from your scan to find him.

834
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,830
You'd have to scan everyone in San fransokyo.

835
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,010
That might take, I don't know, forever.

836
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,530
No, no, no, no. I...

837
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,880
I just have to look for another angle.

838
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,510
Got it!

839
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,530
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

840
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,230
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

841
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,710
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

842
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,670
I need to upgrade all of you.

843
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,030
Upgrade who, now?

844
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,800
Those who suffer a loss

845
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,700
require support from friends and loved ones.

846
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,240
Okay, I like where this is heading!

847
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,910
We can't go against that guy! We're nerds!

848
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,270
Hiro, we want to help,

849
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,630
but we're just us.

850
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
No.

851
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,230
You can be way more.

852
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,840
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

853
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,960
We're in.

854
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,740
Can you feel it? You guys, do you feel this?

855
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,650
Our origin story begins.

856
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,740
We're gonna be superheroes!

857
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,060
Arms up.

858
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,430
The neurotransmitter must be in his mask.

859
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,820
We get the mask, and he can't control the bots.

860
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,980
Game over.

861
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,050
They say "We are what we are"

862
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,950
But we don't have to be

863
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,680
I'm bad behavior

864
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,710
But I do it in the best way

865
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,930
I'll be the watcher

866
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,100
Of the eternal flame

867
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,500
I'll be the guard dog

868
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,560
Of all your fever dreams

869
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,990
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass

870
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,540
Cause we could be immortals

871
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,300
Immortals

872
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,620
Just not for long for long

873
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,210
Live with me forever now

874
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,700
Pull the blackout curtains down

875
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,470
Just not for long for long

876
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,720
We could be immortals

877
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,520
Immortals

878
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,720
Immortals

879
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:46,320
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith

880
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,860
Is when it's tested again and again every day

881
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,330
I'm still comparing your past to my future

882
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,210
Cause we could be immortals

883
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,780
Immortals

884
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,250
Just not for long for long

885
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,250
Super jump!

886
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,550
Super jump!

887
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,050
Pull the blackout curtains down

888
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:13,970
-I breathe fire. -Just not for long for long

889
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,270
We could be immortals

890
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,780
Immortals

891
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:28,150
Immortals

892
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:32,910
Immortals

893
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,740
Immortals

894
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,220
I love it!

895
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,440
Not bad.

896
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,440
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

897
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,560
Hey, guys!

898
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,640
Check this out.

899
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,320
I'd like to introduce,

900
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,050
Baymax 2.0.

901
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,950
He's glorious.

902
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,590
Hold up. Focus.

903
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,010
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

904
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,430
The fist, show them the fist.

905
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,600
No, not that.

906
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,520
The thing, the other thing.

907
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,870
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

908
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,400
That's just one of his new upgrades!

909
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,330
Baymax, wings.

910
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,170
No way!

911
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,800
Thrusters.

912
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,440
I fail to see how flying

913
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,690
makes me a better healthcare companion.

914
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,770
I fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome!

915
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,310
Full thrust.

916
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,740
Steady, big guy.

917
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,660
Look, let's just take this slow.

918
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,830
Up, up, up, up, up!

919
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,240
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

920
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,040
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

921
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,660
Too much thrust!

922
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
No, no, no, no!

923
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,620
Back on! Back on!

924
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,310
On! On! On!

925
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,320
Go up! Up, up, up!

926
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,970
Oh, man!

927
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,330
Maybe... Maybe enough flying for today.

928
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
What do you say?

929
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,160
Your neurotransmitter levels are rising steadily.

930
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,650
Which means what?

931
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,290
The treatment is working.

932
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,820
Oh, no!

933
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,410
No, no, no, no, no!

934
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,760
Whoa, Baymax!

935
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,090
Yes!

936
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,290
That was...

937
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,410
That was...

938
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,080
Sick.

939
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,290
It is just an expression.

940
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,540
That's... that's right, buddy.

941
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:21,380
I am never taking the bus again.

942
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,430
Your emotional state has improved.

943
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,470
I can deactivate if you say you are satisfied with your care.

944
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,400
What?

945
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,240
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

946
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,910
We still have to find that guy.

947
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,030
So, fire up that super-sensor.

948
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,210
Functionality improved.

949
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,280
1000% increase in range.

950
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,840
I have found a match,

951
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,970
on that island.

952
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,590
-Killer view. -Yeah. If I...

953
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,760
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

954
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,050
I'd probably love this.

955
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,520
But I'm terrified of heights, so I don't love it.

956
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,240
There. Baymax, take us in.

957
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,820
Awesome!

958
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,280
Our first landing together as a team.

959
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,240
Guys, come on.

960
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,500
"Quarantine"?

961
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,410
Do you people know what "Quarantine" Means?

962
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,480
"Quarantine."

963
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,940
Enforced isolation to prevent contamination

964
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,980
that could lead to disease, or, in some cases, death.

965
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,210
There's a skull face on this one.

966
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,420
A skull face!

967
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,800
Be ready.

968
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,840
He could be anywhere.

969
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,060
Fire!

970
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,360
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

971
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,410
That was a bird.

972
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,950
Well, at least we know our gear works.

973
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,100
Six intrepid friends

974
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,520
Led by Fred

975
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,350
Their leader, Fred

976
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,850
Fred's angels

977
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,430
Fred's angels

978
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,370
Harnessing the power of the sun with the

979
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,190
Ancient amulet they found in the attic

980
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,730
The amulet is green

981
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,210
It's probably an emerald

982
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,660
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.

983
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,290
Guys, Shhhh...

984
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,200
Any sign of him, Baymax?

985
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,420
This structure is interfering with my sensor.

986
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,170
Perfect. The robot's broken.

987
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,640
Guys, you might want to see this.

988
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,010
What do you think it is, genius?

989
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,860
I'm not sure. But look.

990
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,610
Hiro.

991
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,260
Krei.

992
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:57,860
That's right.

993
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,400
We were asked to do the impossible.

994
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
That's what we did.

995
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:06,450
We've reinvented the very concept of transportation.

996
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:11,150
Friends, I present project Silent Sparrow.

997
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,930
General, may I?

998
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,720
Magic hat!

999
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,740
Teleportation.

1000
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,120
The transport of matter instantaneously through space.

1001
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,260
Not science fiction anymore.

1002
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:45,960
Now, we didn't spend billions of tax dollars to teleport hats.

1003
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,860
Ladies and gentlemen, you're here to witness history.

1004
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,300
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?

1005
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,620
We've invited all these people.

1006
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,360
Might as well give 'em a show.

1007
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,850
T-minus 30 seconds to launch.

1008
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,580
-29, 28... -This is argo.

1009
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,420
-Capsule's in position. -27...

1010
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,980
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity

1011
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,810
in the magnetic containment field.

1012
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,210
Mr. Krei, is there a problem?

1013
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,810
No. No problem.

1014
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,420
It's well within the parameters.

1015
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,930
Let's move forward.

1016
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,930
3, 2, 1.

1017
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,610
Cabin pressure is go.

1018
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,640
Pod engaged.

1019
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,780
Field breach! Abort!

1020
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,160
We've lost all contact with the pod.

1021
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,540
Oh, no.

1022
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,550
-It's breaking up! -The pilot is gone.

1023
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,200
Portal two is down.

1024
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,370
The magnetic containment field's down!

1025
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,630
Krei, shut it down now!

1026
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,550
I want this island sealed off!

1027
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,390
The government shut down Krei's experiment.

1028
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,340
And he's using your microbots to steal his machine back.

1029
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,480
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1030
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,350
Oh, no.

1031
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,620
Baymax, get us out of here.

1032
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,990
Go for the transmitter.

1033
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,660
Behind his mask.

1034
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,550
Baymax!

1035
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,660
All right, what's the plan?

1036
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,220
It's Fred time.

1037
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,290
Super jump!

1038
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,970
Gravity crush!

1039
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,500
Falling hard.

1040
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,350
Seriously, what is the plan?

1041
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,890
-Get the mask. -Right behind you.

1042
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,100
For real, what is the plan?

1043
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,010
Hey!

1044
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,900
You want to dance, masked man?

1045
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,780
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.

1046
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,900
Hand over the mask, or you'll get a taste of this!

1047
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,160
And a little bit of that!

1048
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,580
Hey! I did all right.

1049
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,670
Is that all you got?

1050
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,250
You got that, too?

1051
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,420
It's back into the fire!

1052
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,240
It's over, Krei.

1053
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,380
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1054
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,790
The explosion...

1055
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,130
You died.

1056
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,800
No. I had your microbots.

1057
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,800
But, Tadashi.

1058
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,070
You just let him die.

1059
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,480
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1060
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,110
He went in there to save you!

1061
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,650
That was his mistake!

1062
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,790
Baymax, destroy.

1063
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,250
My programing prevents me from injuring a human being.

1064
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,700
Not anymore.

1065
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,630
Hiro, this is not what...

1066
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,510
Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!

1067
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,010
No! Stop, Baymax!

1068
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,900
No, stop! He's getting away!

1069
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,740
Baymax!

1070
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,100
My healthcare protocol has been violated.

1071
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,870
I regret any distress I may have caused.

1072
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,360
How could you do that? I had him!

1073
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,360
What you just did, we never signed up for.

1074
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,710
We said we'd catch the guy.

1075
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:31,950
That's it.

1076
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,080
I never should have let you help me!

1077
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,040
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1078
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,220
My enhanced scanner has been damaged.

1079
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,670
Wings.

1080
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,050
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1081
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,550
Fly!

1082
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,340
Hiro!

1083
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,740
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1084
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,170
You appear to be distressed.

1085
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,870
I'm fine!

1086
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,870
There. Is it working?

1087
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,800
- My sensor is operational. - Good.

1088
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,590
Then let's get...

1089
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,290
What?

1090
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,600
Are you going to remove my healthcare chip?

1091
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,420
Yes. Open!

1092
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,510
My purpose is to heal the sick and injured.

1093
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,680
Baymax, open your access port.

1094
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,470
Do you want me to terminate Professor Callaghan?

1095
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,610
Just open!

1096
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,670
Will terminating Professor Callaghan

1097
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,520
improve your emotional state?

1098
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,910
Yes! No! I don't know!

1099
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,150
Open your access!

1100
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,660
- Is this what Tadashi wanted? - It doesn't matter!

1101
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,080
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1102
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,460
Tadashi's gone!

1103
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,380
Tadashi's gone.

1104
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,510
Tadashi is here.

1105
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,050
No. He's not here.

1106
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,090
Tadashi is here.

1107
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,090
This is Tadashi Hamada.

1108
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,940
And this is the first test of my robotics project.

1109
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,440
Hello, I am Baymax.

1110
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,240
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1111
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,370
The seventh test of my robotics project.

1112
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,790
Hello, I...

1113
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,120
What? What?

1114
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,410
Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop scan! Stop...

1115
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,990
Tadashi Hamada again,

1116
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:43,420
and this is the 33rd test of my robotics project.

1117
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,100
I'm not giving up on you.

1118
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,880
You don't understand this yet, but people need you.

1119
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,730
So, let's get back to work.

1120
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,010
This is Tadashi Hamada,

1121
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,650
and this is the 84th test.

1122
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,450
What do you say, big guy?

1123
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,070
Hello, I am Baymax,

1124
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,160
your personal healthcare companion.

1125
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,440
It works.

1126
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,830
It works!

1127
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:17,500
This is amazing! You... you work!

1128
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,090
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.

1129
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,370
I knew it. Oh, you work. I can't believe it! I can't...

1130
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,010
Okay. All right, big moment, here.

1131
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,390
Scan me.

1132
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:32,310
Your neurotransmitter levels are elevated.

1133
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,590
This indicates that you are happy.

1134
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:37,140
I am. I really am.

1135
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,180
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.

1136
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,100
You're gonna help so many people, buddy.

1137
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,850
So many.

1138
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,730
That's all for now. I am satisfied with my care.

1139
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,790
Thank you, Baymax.

1140
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,840
I'm so sorry.

1141
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,540
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1142
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,550
Hiro.

1143
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,060
Guys, I, I...

1144
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,980
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1145
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,360
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1146
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,290
But maybe don't leave your team

1147
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,240
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1148
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,240
- Oh, man. - Nah, it's cool.

1149
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,460
Heathcliff picked us up in the family chopper.

1150
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,410
Hiro, we found something you should see.

1151
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,750
You almost got us all killed!

1152
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,090
Krei! You did this!

1153
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,040
You knew it wasn't ready!

1154
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,970
Callaghan? He was there?

1155
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,270
He was such a good man. What happened?

1156
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,730
I don't know.

1157
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,690
But the answer's here somewhere.

1158
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,350
Wait, wait! Stop.

1159
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,140
There he is.

1160
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
With the pilot.

1161
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:11,400
Hang on.

1162
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,480
We've invited all these people...

1164
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,740
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1165
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,950
Callaghan blames Krei.

1166
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,570
This is a revenge story.

1167
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,670
So, what are we waiting for?

1168
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,670
It's all set up.

1169
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:38,340
This beautiful new campus is the culmination of a lifelong dream.

1170
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:41,130
But none of this would've been possible

1171
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,600
without a few bumps in the road.

1172
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:47,670
Those setbacks made us stronger,

1174
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,530
and set us on the path to a bright future.

1175
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,110
What is that?

1176
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,600
- What? - Setback?

1177
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,490
Was my daughter a "Setback"?

1178
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,920
Callaghan! But you...

1179
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,010
Your daughter, that...

1180
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,500
That was an accident.

1181
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,540
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1182
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,270
My daughter is gone because of your arrogance.

1183
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,140
What are you doing?

1184
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,140
You took everything from me

1185
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,450
when you sent Abigail into that machine.

1186
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,250
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1187
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,580
No!

1188
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,330
No! No! You can't!

1189
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,060
You're going to watch everything you've built disappear.

1190
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,810
Then, it's your turn.

1191
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,670
Professor Callaghan!

1192
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,320
Let him go!

1193
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,280
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1194
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,190
Abigail is gone!

1195
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,530
This won't change anything. Trust me, I know.

1196
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,400
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1197
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,620
Please, let me go.

1198
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,790
I'll give you anything you want!

1199
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,420
I want my daughter back!

1200
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,290
Go for the mask!

1201
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,570
Baymax!

1202
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,230
Leaping into action!

1203
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,680
Oh, no!

1204
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,510
Getting a little... A little tight.

1205
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,780
- No! - He's too strong!

1206
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,130
- There's no way out! - You can't beat him!

1207
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,620
Help! I can't beat him.

1208
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,050
Hiro!

1209
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,470
- Hiro? Hiro? - Help!

1210
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,180
- That's it! - Hiro.

1211
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,590
- I know how to beat him. - Hiro.

1212
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,640
Listen up!

1213
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,050
Use those big brains of yours,

1214
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,600
and think your way around the problem.

1215
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,170
Look for a new angle.

1216
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,230
My arms! They can't go any further!

1217
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,750
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1218
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,620
Hello, sign.

1219
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,120
Care to go for a little spin?

1220
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,750
Double spin!

1221
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:36,910
Behind-the-back spin!

1222
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,770
Baymax!

1223
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,780
Hiro.

1224
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,130
I love that robot!

1225
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,130
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.

1226
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,560
Take out the bots. They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1227
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,230
Now that is a plan!

1228
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,430
Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover?

1229
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,400
Like you have to ask.

1230
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,640
Let's do this, Freddie!

1231
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,610
Smokescreen!

1232
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,150
Ready and

1233
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,250
dive!

1234
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,210
Whoa, the gravity's getting a little weird here, guys!

1235
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,760
Wait. Let's use this!

1236
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,850
These are green blades of fury!

1237
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,800
Woman up!

1238
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,890
Double sign-spin.

1239
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,280
Now my signs are on fire!

1240
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,630
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1241
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:45,220
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1242
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,750
Hammerfist.

1243
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,380
This ends now!

1244
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,070
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1245
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,310
What?

1246
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,410
Baymax!

1247
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,240
No!

1248
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,210
Our programing prevents us from injuring a human being.

1249
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,800
But we'll take that.

1250
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,540
It's still on! We have to shut it down!

1251
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,000
We can't! The containment field is failing.

1252
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,420
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1253
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,290
We need to get out of here, now!

1254
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,970
Baymax!

1255
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,350
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1256
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,380
- What? - Coming from there.

1257
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,310
The life signs are female.

1258
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,730
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1259
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,070
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.

1260
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,610
Abigail.

1261
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,440
Let's go get her.

1262
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,320
The portal is destabilizing. You'll never make it.

1263
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:36,490
She's alive in there.

1264
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,370
Someone has to help.

1265
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,280
What do you say, buddy?

1266
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,160
Flying makes me a better healthcare companion.

1267
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,940
Careful! There's Krei tech debris everywhere.

1268
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,120
Look out!

1269
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,430
I have located the patient.

1270
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,680
Hurry!

1271
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,920
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1272
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,540
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1273
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,090
Veer right!

1274
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,020
Okay, to the left.

1275
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,230
Hard right!

1276
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,680
Up and over.

1277
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,270
Okay, level off. Easy.

1278
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,440
Nice flying!

1279
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,360
Almost there!

1280
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,630
Baymax!

1281
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:00,220
Baymax!

1282
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,300
My thrusters are inoperable.

1283
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,430
Just grab hold.

1284
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:24,400
There is still a way I can get you both to safety.

1285
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,330
I cannot deactivate until you say

1286
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,450
you are satisfied with your care.

1287
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,950
No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you?

1288
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,830
- You are my patient. - Baymax.

1289
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,420
Your health is my only concern.

1290
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,170
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1291
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,920
Are you satisfied with your care?

1292
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,850
No. There's gotta be another way.

1293
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,970
I'm not gonna leave you here. I'll think of something.

1294
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,520
There is no time.

1295
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,430
Are you satisfied with your care?

1296
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,140
Please! No.

1297
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,320
I can't lose you, too.

1298
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,780
Hiro, I will always be with you.

1299
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,890
I'm satisfied with my care.

1300
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,930
Hiro!

1301
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,100
Yeah! They made it!

1302
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,060
Baymax?

1303
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:31,750
Miss, can you hear me?

1304
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,460
What is your name?

1305
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,570
Abigail Callaghan.

1306
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,380
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.

1307
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,800
We're taking you to the hospital.

1308
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,040
Move it!

1309
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,550
Get in there.

1310
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,150
A massive cleanup continues today

1311
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,320
at the headquarters of Krei Tech Industries.

1313
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:06,730
Reports are still flooding in

1314
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,830
about a group of unidentified individuals,

1315
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,110
who prevented what could have been a major catastrophe.

1316
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,820
The whole city of San Fransokyo is asking,

1317
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,320
"Who are these heroes? And where are they now?"

1318
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,080
It's so exciting.

1319
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:22,510
Hey, sweetie!

1320
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,760
Okay.

1321
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,340
Last hug.

1322
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:31,680
Bye!

1323
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,340
- And just then I was like... - Get out of here.

1324
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,720
I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.

1325
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,530
Hello, Hiro.

1326
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,700
We didn't set out to be superheroes,

1327
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:43,080
but sometimes life doesn't go the way you planned.

1328
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,260
The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people,

1329
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,000
and that's what we're gonna do.

1330
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,720
Who are we?

1334
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:26,440
Dad, I just wish I could share my accomplishments with you.

1335
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:28,450
You mean so much to me, and honestly,

1336
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,940
I've always felt a distance

1337
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:33,360
what with you being on the family island all the time,

1338
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,730
and I just wish you could see how...

1339
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,130
Fred.

1340
01:40:58,970 --> 01:40:59,970
Son.

1341
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:01,940
Dad?

1342
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:08,310
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.

1343
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:13,620
I go inside out, then I go front and back.

1344
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:14,990
Dad!

1345
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,290
We have a lot to talk about.
